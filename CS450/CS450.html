<p>In this course, the main project (worth 30%) is to design a MIPS processor in Verilog. No required textbooks. The main topic is about how modern CPUs manage to achieve the performance that they do, building on top of the processor basics covered in earlier processor design courses.</p>
<p>There are also two written assignments (worth 20% total) and the final exam (worth 50%). Assignments have 4 grace days allowed.</p>
<p>Hardware description languages are used for modelling hardware, generally for the purpose of simulation or synthesis. Most complex digital hardware is designed using a hardware description language, which is then compiled and converted into specifications for FPGAs, ASICs, programmable logic, and so on.</p>
<p>The main hardware description languages in use today are System Verilog and VHDL. VHDL is more verbose and Ada-like, while Verilog is more minimalist and C-like. Most projects in industry use Verilog for this reason. System Verilog is a superset of plain Verilog, and all Verilog code works in System Verilog. There's also System C, which looks a lot more like C/C++, but it's not commonly used. In this course, we will be using Icarus Verilog (an implementation of System Verilog), version 10 or later (in order to get support for SystemVerilog).</p>
<p>The simplest/lowest-level of hardware modelling in System Verilog is <strong>gate-level modelling</strong>. At this level, we have logic gate primitives like AND/OR, and we can connect them together into circuits via <strong>wires</strong>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode verilog"><code class="sourceCode verilog"># <span class="ot">`a1</span>` is the name of the gate, which is optional but useful <span class="kw">for</span> labelling gates
# <span class="ot">`y</span>` is the gate <span class="dt">output</span>, <span class="dt">and</span> <span class="ot">`a</span>`/<span class="ot">`b</span>`/<span class="ot">`c</span>` are the gate inputs (<span class="ot">`and</span>` supports one <span class="dt">or</span> more of these inputs, <span class="dt">and</span> one <span class="dt">output</span>)
# the inputs <span class="dt">and</span> outputs are wires, identified by name - everywhere that same name is used can be thought of as being all connected together by a physical <span class="dt">wire</span>
<span class="dt">and</span> a1(y, a, b, c)

# every argument except the last are the NOT gate&#39;s outputs, <span class="dt">and</span> the last one is the <span class="dt">input</span>
<span class="dt">not</span> (y1, y2, a)</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="gate-level-modelling">Gate-level modelling</h2>
<p>In gate-level modelling, signal/wire values can be <code>0</code> (low), <code>1</code> (high), <code>x</code>/<code>X</code> (unknown/ignored value), or <code>z</code>/<code>Z</code> (high impedance).</p>
<p>Gate-level modelling for a full adder (addend bits as <code>a</code>/<code>b</code>, carry-in as <code>c_in</code>, carry-out as <code>c_out</code>, sum as <code>sum</code>):</p>

<span class="kw">endmodule</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is a <strong>design module</strong>. It fully specifies the full adder as a self-contained unit.</p>
<p>While this looks like normal procedural code, with various function calls, it is more intuitive to think of this as a series of logical declarations - as if each of the <code>xor</code>/<code>and</code>/<code>or</code> lines were all continuously running at the same time.</p>
<p>A <strong>test bench</strong> is a set of definitions that instantiates the design module, and simulates the circuit under different input conditions to test for functional correctness. For our full adder example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode verilog"><code class="sourceCode verilog"><span class="co">// full_adder_test_bench.sv</span>
<span class="kw">module</span> full_adder_test_bench;

    <span class="co">// below, we&#39;re basically instantiating a full adder (defined in the code above) that&#39;s connected to our logics, for testing purposes</span>
    <span class="co">// the `.name(other_name)` syntax is a &quot;named port map&quot;, which lets us connect logics to devices by signal name</span>
    <span class="co">// alternatively, we can just map the signals in order, like `full_adder dut(x, y, carry_in, carry_out, z)`, but this can cause issues if we change the inputs/outputs of the full adder</span>

<p><strong>Heirarchical design</strong> is the idea of using lower-level modules in higher-level modules. For example, a carry-lookahead adder module might instantiate a few ripple-carry adders, which in turn might instantiate a bunch of full-adders:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode verilog"><code class="sourceCode verilog"><span class="co">// adder_4_bit.sv</span>

    full_adder fa0(.c_out(carry[<span class="dv">2</span>]), .sum(sum[<span class="dv">1</span>]), .c_in(carry[<span class="dv">1</span>]), .a(a[<span class="dv">1</span>]), .b(b[<span class="dv">1</span>]));
    full_adder fa0(.c_out(carry[<span class="dv">3</span>]), .sum(sum[<span class="dv">2</span>]), .c_in(carry[<span class="dv">2</span>]), .a(a[<span class="dv">2</span>]), .b(b[<span class="dv">2</span>]));

<span class="kw">endmodule</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that there's a lot of similar statements for the full adder definitions. In these cases, we can use generate statements to remove duplicated code. It looks somewhat like a loop, but it's more of a macro that gets expanded into multiple statements at compile time:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode verilog"><code class="sourceCode verilog"><span class="co">// adder_4_bit_generate.sv</span>
<span class="kw">module</span> adder_<span class="dv">4</span>_bit(<span class="dt">output</span> c_out, <span class="dt">output</span> [<span class="dv">3</span>:<span class="dv">0</span>] sum, <span class="dt">input</span> c_in, <span class="dt">input</span> [<span class="dv">3</span>:<span class="dv">0</span>] a, b);
    logic [<span class="dv">4</span>:<span class="dv">0</span>] carry;
    
    <span class="kw">generate</span>
        <span class="dt">genvar</span> i;

            full_adder fa(.c_out(carry[i+<span class="dv">1</span>]), .sum(sum[i]), .c_in(carry[i]) ,.a(a[i]), .b(b[i]));
        <span class="kw">end</span>
    <span class="kw">endgenerate</span>

    <span class="co">// since it would be really inconvenient to specify our c_in and c_out in the generate statement, we just used extra indices in the carry wire, and then assign the inputs/outputs accordingly</span>
    <span class="kw">assign</span> carry[<span class="dv">0</span>] = c_in; <span class="co">// this is a continuous assignment statement - it&#39;s sort of like a one-way wire for the c_in signal in this case, but it can also do things like combinational logic with different gates and stuff</span>
    <span class="kw">assign</span> c_out = carry[<span class="dv">4</span>]; <span class="co">// since the assignment is unidirectional, the inputs are on the right side of the equal sign, and the outputs are on the left side</span>
<span class="kw">endmodule</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Usually for loops are discouraged, but they're fine for generate statements - in other contexts, they might not compile to actual hardware.</p>
<h2 id="dataflow-modelling">Dataflow modelling</h2>
<p>Dataflow modelling is the next level of abstraction above gate-level modelling. Dataflow modelling deals only with combinational circuits, by representing them with continuous assignment statements.</p>
<p>Basically, we represent what logical operations the circuit needs to do, and the compiler will figure out what kind of gate layout we need. For example, for a full adder it might automatically decide to reuse the <code>xor(a, b)</code> gate.</p>
<p>For example, we might model a full adder using dataflow modelling as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode verilog"><code class="sourceCode verilog"><span class="co">// full_adder_dataflow.sv</span>
<span class="kw">module</span> full_adder(<span class="dt">output</span> c_out, sum, <span class="dt">input</span> c_in, a, b);
    <span class="co">// the value of `sum` is continuously updated based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c_in` - whenever any of those change, `sum` reflects the new value</span>
    <span class="co">// this updating is not true of all continuous assignment statements, however</span>
    <span class="kw">assign</span> sum = a ^ b ^ c_in;
    <span class="kw">assign</span> c_out = ((a ^ b) &amp; c_in) | (a &amp; b);

    <span class="co">// actually, Verilog has a `+` operator, so it&#39;s really as simple as `assign {c_out, sum} = a + b + c_in`</span>
    <span class="co">// `assign` will truncate the result of evaluating the right hand side, if the right hand side has more bits than the left</span>
    <span class="co">// `assign` will zero-extend the result of evaluating the right hand side, if the right hand side has fewer bits than the left</span>
<span class="kw">endmodule</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Some of the available operators are <code>!</code> (logical NOT), <code>&amp;&amp;</code> (logical AND), <code>||</code> (logical OR), <code>+</code> (two's complement addition), <code>-</code> (two's complement subtraction), <code>*</code> (multiplication), <code>/</code> (division), <code>%</code> (remainder), <code>**</code> (exponentiation), <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>~</code> (NOT), <code>&amp;</code> (AND), <code>|</code> (OR), <code>^</code> (XOR), <code>^~</code> (XNOR), <code>&lt;&lt;</code> (bit shift left), <code>&gt;&gt;</code> (bit shift right), <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> (signed shift right - extends sign bit), <code>{a_1, ..., a_n}</code> (concatenate <code>a_1</code> through to <code>a_n</code>), <code>{n{a}}</code> (replicate <code>a</code> by <code>n</code> times - repeatedly concatenate <code>a</code>), <code>c?a:b</code> (MUX - select <code>a</code> if <code>c</code> is high, <code>b</code> otherwise). They generally have precedence similar to their equivalents in C and Python.</p>
<p>For example, the nibbles of a byte can be swapped with <code>assign {b[3:0], b[7:4]} = a[7:0]</code>, and an 8-bit signed integer can be sign-extended to 16 bits with <code>assign b[15:0] = {{8{a[7]}}, a[7:0]}</code>.</p>
<p>With all these useful operators, it's pretty straightforward to make a 4-bit adder:</p>

<h2 id="behaviour-modelling">Behaviour modelling</h2>
<p>Behaviour modelling is the next level of abstraction above dataflow-level modelling. It uses procedural blocks that are <code>initial</code>.</p>
<p>An <code>initial</code> block runs the statements inside of it once starting at time 0. An <code>always</code> block runs the statements inside of it whenever certain things change.</p>

<p>First assignment is posted, it shouldn't take more than 5 minutes to complete.</p>
<p>For behaviour modelling, we have a lot of useful SystemVerilog constructs:</p>
<ul>
<li>if-else: <code>if (expression) statement1 else statement2</code></li>
<li>case-swtich: <code>case (expression) expression1: statement1; expression2: statement2; default: statement4 endcase</code> (default case is optional)</li>
<li>for/while/repeat/forever: <code>repeat(10) begin statements end</code> (avoid these if at all possible - they aren't always sythesizable, only usable in simulations).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that with if statements and other conditionals, if we don't explicitly set the value of a logic, then it retains its current value.</p>
<p>Let's implement a mux:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode verilog"><code class="sourceCode verilog"><span class="kw">module</span> mux_<span class="dv">2</span>_input(<span class="dt">output</span> logic d, <span class="dt">input</span> i0, i1, select);

            <span class="dv">0</span>: d = i0;
            <span class="dv">1</span>: d = i1;
            <span class="kw">default</span>: d = z; <span class="co">// the default case handles unknown and high impedance - we&#39;ll just turn the output off (high impedance)</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="synchronous-circuits">Synchronous Circuits</h2>
<p>Recall that a synchronous circuit is one that only updates on a clock edge. In this course our synchronous circuits are updated on the rising edge of the clock (CMOS is actually clocked on the falling edge).</p>
<p>A test bench for a synchronous circuit needs to generate a clock signal. This might look like the following:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode verilog"><code class="sourceCode verilog"><span class="kw">module</span> synchronous_test_bench;
    logic clk;
    <span class="kw">initial</span> <span class="kw">begin</span>
        clk = <span class="dv">1</span>;
        <span class="kw">forever</span> <span class="bn">#5</span> clk = ~clk;
    <span class="kw">end</span>
<span class="kw">endmodule</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Blocks can be triggered on edge events, like <code>always @ (posedge clk)</code> (trigger on rising edge) or <code>always @ (negedge clk)</code>.</p>
<p>SystemVerilog actually has two assignment operators. <code>=</code> is a blocking assignment, where all updates happen in order (we use this for combinational logic). <code>&lt;=</code> is non-blocking assignment, where all the right hand sides are computed before the updates happen (this is used for register-like or latched output). For example, <code>a &lt;= b; b &lt;= a</code> swaps <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, while <code>a = b; b = a</code> just sets <code>a</code> to <code>b</code>. Generally, we prefer <code>&lt;=</code> over <code>=</code> when possible, so everywhere outside of combinational logic (we generally want outputs to all update at once, at the end of an update).</p>
<p>System Verilog uses <strong>discrete event simulation</strong>. Simulations consist of concurrent processes, primitives, modules, procedural blocks, and continuous assignments. Changes to signals are <strong>update events</strong>, and processes respond to events they are sensitive to and add them to a process-specific event queue, which are then executed.</p>
<p>System Verilog lets us define constants with <code>parameter some_constant = 8</code>. This is often used to define how many bits a particular element is. There's also enumerations, like <code>enum bit[1:0] {IDLE, REQUEST, WAIT, RECEIVE} state</code>. Logics can also be defined as arrays, like <code>logic [7:0] some_array [0:3];</code> (array of 4 8-bit registers), and are accessed with <code>y = a[2]</code> and so on.</p>
<p>System Verilog has various &quot;system tasks&quot;, which trigger actions during simulations. For example, <code>$display(...)</code> outputs to console, <code>$monitor(...)</code> outputs to console whenever the given signals are updated, and <code>$stop</code> stops the simulation.</p>

<p>Room has been moved to HH 1102, which should be a lot closer to campus than OPT.</p>
<h2 id="processor-design">Processor Design</h2>
<p>There are multiple levels of abstraction when talking about a processor design. From most abstract to least abstract, the main ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instruction-set architecture (ISA) - defines functional behaviour like instruction format, addressing modes, hazards, registers, privileges, exceptions, etc. For example, IA32 (also known as x86), IA64/AMD64 (also known as x86-64), PowerPC, MIPS, ARM, RISC-V.</li>
<li>Microarchitecture - defines the hardware structure like pipeline structure, cache organization, branch prediction schemes. For example, Intel i386, Intel i486, Intel Skylake, MIPS R16000.</li>
<li>Implementation - defines physical realization like gate design, transistor technology, fabrication technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the 1980s the main focus in processor design was improving single core performance and clock speed. Today, focus is on more cores at a lower clock speed, and doing more with each cycle (modern Intel CPUs can do 4-8 instructions per cycle!). New microarchitecture-level techniques like instruction-level parallelism (parallelism within 1 thread) and hyperthreading (parallelism between multiple threads on one core), speculative execution (running both sides of a branch and then throwing away the wrong one once the branch is done), out of order execution (rearranging instructions to improve parallelism) have also resulted in significant performance gains. The main issue preventing more single core performance and clock speed is the <strong>power wall</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic power consumption</strong> is the power consumed that depends on the processor workload. When a transistor switches, it must use energy proportional to the capacitive load times the voltage squared. So the power used (switching frequency times switching energy) quicky increases linearly with the switching frequency, resulting in increased cooling requirements and worse battery life. One technique modern processors use to try to get around this is to reduce the switching voltage to quadratically reduce the switching energy required - for example, a 15% reduction in voltage results in a 28% reduction in switching energy.</p>
<p>There's also <strong>static energy consumption</strong>, the power consumed regardless of the processor workload. As transistors get smaller, the leakage current increases (due to quantum tunneling in the transistor junctions), which means more power used per transistor.</p>
<p>Modern techniques involve thread-level parallelism (doing multiple tasks at once), and data-level parallelism (doing something to multiple pieces of data at once).</p>
<p><strong>Fynn's taxonomy</strong> characterizes four classes of parallelism:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single-instruction single-data - single processing unit acting on single pieces of data. For example, a core calculating one scalar value. For these, we can take advantage of instruction-level parallelism.</li>
<li>Single-instruction multiple-data - single processing unit acting on multiple pieces of data. For example, DSP units, GPUs, vector instructions. For these, we can take advantage of data-level and instruction-level parallelism.</li>
<li>Multiple-instruction single-data - multiple processing units acting on single pieces of data. Not really used in practice.</li>
<li>Multiple-instruction multiple-data - multiple processing units acting on multiple pieces of data. For example, multithreading and multiprocessing. For these, we can take advantage of thread-level, data-level, and instruction-level parallelism.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recall MIPS:</p>
<ul>
<li>32-bit instructions, in one of two formats. First format: 6 bits for opcode, 5 bits for register operand 1, 5 bits for register operand 2, upper 16 bits for immediate value. Second format: 6-bit opcode, 5 bits each for register operand 1, 2, and 3, 5-bit shift amount, and 6-bit shift type specifier. See CS241 notes for more details about MIPS instructions.</li>
<li>32 registers R0 to R31, R0 always has value 0.</li>
<li>In this course, we'll use a 5-stage pipeline for fetch, decode, execute, memory, and writeback. We can overlap up to 5 instructions at once.</li>
<li>Instruction flow is linear (statically scheduled), and one instruction is completed per cycle (ideally). In other words, instructions are run in whatever order they're stored as, and we don't dynamically rearrange to improve parallelism.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="section-5">19/1/17</h1>
<p>Sometimes instructions in a pipeline depend on others. There are three main types of these dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>A read-after-write dependency is when an instruction needs to read out the value that some other instruction wrote - if the CPU ran both at once, we might read the wrong value. This is the only real dependency in scalar, statically-scheduled pipelines.</li>
<li>A write-after-read dependency is an anti-dependency - if the CPU reorders these instructions so that they're in the opposite order, we might read the wrong value.</li>
<li>A write-after-write dependency is an output dependency - if the CPU reorders these instructions so that they're in the opposite order, the final value of the register may be wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>When instructions aren't dependent on each other, we can more-or-less freely rearrange them. This allows efficient pipelining and parallelism.</p>
<p><strong>Total sequential execution</strong> (TSE) is an assumption in our programming model that one instruction finishes before the next starts. TSE is sufficient but not necessary for semantic correctness. In fact, semantic correctness can be satisfied just by satisfying the inter-instruction dependencies of the original program - we can otherwise rearrange and overlap instructions however we want.</p>
<p>Since we have five stages (fetch, decode, execute, memory, writeback), an instruction that writes registers takes 4 cycles after it's been fetched before the write actually takes effect, assuming 1 cycle per pipeline stage. Likewise, an instruction that reads registers takes 1 cycle after fetching before actually performing the read.</p>
<p>A control dependency is basically a special case of a register dependency, where the register is the program counter. An instruction that branches (writes to the program counter) has its write take effect 1 cycle after being fetched (the MIPS datapath reads PC in fetch stage and writes in decode stage).</p>
<p>In the same way, an instruction that writes to memory has a memory dependency, and has its write take effect 3 cycles after being fetched.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we have two instructions <span class="math inline">A, B</span> that run at clock cycle <span class="math inline">i</span> and <span class="math inline">j</span>, respectively, such that <span class="math inline">i &gt; j</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is a read-after-write register dependency from <span class="math inline">B</span> on <span class="math inline">A</span>, we must satisfy <span class="math inline">j + 1 &gt; i + 4</span> (<span class="math inline">A</span> must do writeback before <span class="math inline">B</span> can decode). Hazards occur if <span class="math inline">j - i \le 3</span>.</li>
<li>If there is a write-after-read register dependency from <span class="math inline">B</span> on <span class="math inline">A</span>, we must satisfy <span class="math inline">j + 4 &gt; i + 1</span> (<span class="math inline">A</span> must decode before <span class="math inline">B</span> can writeback). Hazards are impossible without reordering instructions.</li>

Hazards are impossible without reordering instructions.</li>
<li>If there is a read-after-write control dependency from <span class="math inline">B</span> on <span class="math inline">A</span>, we must satisfy <span class="math inline">j + 0 &gt; i + 1</span> (<span class="math inline">A</span> must decode before <span class="math inline">B</span> fetches). Hazards occur if <span class="math inline">j - i \le 1</span>.</li>
<li>If there is a write-after-read control dependency from <span class="math inline">B</span> on <span class="math inline">A</span>, we must satisfy <span class="math inline">j + 1 &gt; i + 0</span> (<span class="math inline">A</span> must fetch before <span class="math inline">B</span> decodes). Hazards are impossible without reordering instructions.</li>
<li>If there is a write-after-write control dependency from <span class="math inline">B</span> on <span class="math inline">A</span>, we must satisfy <span class="math inline">j + 1 &gt; i + 1</span> (<span class="math inline">A</span> must decode before <span class="math inline">B</span> decodes). Hazards are impossible without reordering instructions.</li>
<li>If there is a read-after-write memory dependency from <span class="math inline">B</span> on <span class="math inline">A</span>, we must satisfy <span class="math inline">j + 3 &gt; i + 3</span> (<span class="math inline">A</span> must do memory before <span class="math inline">B</span> does memory).

Hazards are impossible without reordering instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>hazard</strong> is a potential for a violated dependency (and therefore, violation of semantic correctness). In our pipelined, statically scheduled CPU, the hazards are a 3-cycle register read-after-write, and a 1-cycle control read-after-write.</p>
<p>To avoid hazards, we can insert no-op instructions - 3 NOP instructions after each register read-after-write, or 1 after every control read-after-write. These can be inserted either by the compiler, or the CPU can stall for the necessary number of cycles when the relevant dependencies are found. Compilers are responsible for this in MIPS.</p>
<p>However, a 3-cycle stall for a 3-cycle register read-after-write is quite long. We can shorten register/memory dependency stalls by using <strong>data forwarding</strong> - routing the output of later stages directly to earlier stages to avoid the need for a write/read - earlier stages can read directly from the later stages.</p>
<p>For our purposes, we can route the output of the memory stage to the execute stage (for <span class="math inline">j = i + 1</span>), the output of the writeback stage to the execute stage (for <span class="math inline">j = i + 2</span>), and the output of the writeback stage to the decode stage (for <span class="math inline">j = i + 3</span>). With that in place, each stage always has the data it needs, so we never have to stall.</p>
<p>To implement data forwarding in each stage, we can use multiplexers that choose between either reading/writing registers, or taking input directly from later stages.</p>
<p>Turns out, this can't eliminate all our stalls, though it does make a lot of them much shorter. Consider <code>lw R1, (R2)</code> followed by <code>add R4, R1, R1</code> - the load-word instruction doesn't have its result until the memory stage is done, so we must stall the <code>add</code> for 1 cycle so we can forward it from the write-back stage to the execute stage.</p>
<p>To solve the control dependency read-after-write stall (when we have a conditional branch), we might assume that the branch won't happen, keep executing the next instruction, and then squash/suppress it in the pipeline if we do end up taking the branch.</p>
<p>MIPS uses a different approach - the CPU will execute the instruction after the branch (the instruction after the branch is in a position called the <strong>branch delay slot</strong>), regardless of whether the branch is taken or not. The compiler will generally try to fill the branch delay slot with an instruction that doesn't depend on the branch, or NOP if it can't find one.</p>
<h1 id="section-6">24/1/17</h1>
<p>Recall that in <strong>static scheduling</strong>, instructions are executed in the order that they appear in, and the compiler is responsible for arranging instructions in a way that avoids hazards.</p>
<p>Code example with instruction reordering by the compiler for hazard avoidance.</p>
<p>The cycles per instruction (CPI) is a measure of CPU performance, and is ideally somewhere around 1 for our scalar processor. However, penalty cycles caused by hazards will increase this. For example, if we have 6 instructions that incur 3 penalty cycles, we get <span class="math inline">\frac{6 + 3}{6} = 1.5</span> as the CPI.</p>
<p>The program execution time is <span class="math inline">\frac{n \times \text{CPI}}{f}</span>, where <span class="math inline">n</span> is the number of instructions in the basic block, and <span class="math inline">f</span> is the clock frequency. The speedup of any given piece of code is the new CPI over the old CPI.</p>
<p><strong>Local scheduling</strong> is when the compiler rearranges instructions within a basic block. A <strong>basic block</strong> is a sequence of consecutive instructions such that if one instruction is executed, all of them are - that means only the first instruction can be the target of a branch instruction, and only the last instruction can be a branch instruction (or the second to last for MIPS, due to the branch delay slot).</p>
<p>To perform local scheduling, we first identify the hazards in the code, leaving slots to put other instructions in according to how many penalty cycles are present. For example, if we have a load followed by a dependent add instruction, we might have 1 penalty cycle in our architecture, so we would leave one slot for an instruction. Then, we try to fill in the slots with other instructions while keeping dependencies satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>Global scheduling</strong> is when the compiler rearranges instructions across multiple basic blocks.</p>
<p>A common example of this is loop unrolling, where the body of a loop known to execute <span class="math inline">n</span> times is simply duplicated <span class="math inline">n</span> times - this reduces branching overhead, and makes local scheduling better since it may result in larger basic blocks. While loop unrolling can make our code faster, it results in larger programs, which might cause more instruction cache misses. The compiler must make the tradeoff depending on what would be faster.</p>

<p>Project part 1 marks come out on Monday. Part 2 is out on the course website, building a 5-stage MIPS pipeline. In-class overview of assignment.</p>
<p>In the scalar pipelines we are looking at, exceptions are events that alter program flow. Exceptions are harder to handle than normal program flow because they can occur at any time, and we must make sure registers and memory are properly stored/restored to ensure the TPE assumption is upheld.</p>
<p>Exceptions can be generated by things like interrupts from peripherals, unusual cases for some instructions (invalid opcode, page fault), and trap instructions (instructions that invoke the OS).</p>
<p>Precise exceptions are those that are recoverable - we can return to thread after the exception is handled.</p>
<p>What if we have multiple instructions that generate exceptions simultaneously in the pipeline? For example, we might have a load instruction that tries to dereference a null pointer at the memory stage, while we're trying to decode an invalid instruction in the decode stage - the load instruction generates an exception from the memory stage, and the invalid instruction generates one at the decode stage. To make sure we handle all instructions in the pipeline, we only mark the instruction as having caused an error, then actually handle them in the write-back stage.</p>
<p>There are three types of exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interrupts</strong> are asynchronous exceptions, usually caused by peripherals like keyboards and timers.
<ul>
<li>When an interrupt occurs: the pipeline stops fetching, runs until the pipeline is empty (the pipeline is <strong>drained</strong>), saves state, invokes the interrupt handler routine, restores state, and then jumps to the next instruction in the interrupted thread..</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Faults</strong> are synchronous exceptions, handled in write-back stage.
<ul>
<li>When a fault occurs: the pipeline stops fetching, cancels all instructions in the pipeline (the pipeline is <strong>flushed</strong>), saves state, invokes the fault handler routine, restores state, and then jumps back to the instruction that caused the fault.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Traps</strong> are synchronous exceptions, detected in write-back stage.
<ul>
<li>When a fault occurs: the pipeline stops fetching, finishes the trap, cancels all instructions in the pipeline (the pipeline is <strong>flushed</strong>), saves state, invokes the trap handler routine, restores state, and then jumps to the instruction after the one that caused the trap.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Very Long Instruction Word (WLIV) architectures are architectures that have very large instructions, generally able to issue multiple operations at once. For example, Intel Itanium has 128-bit instructions, able to contain up to 3 operations each.</p>
<p>If and only if an architecture can handle multiple instructions per cycle, it is known as a <strong>superscalar architecture</strong>.</p>
<p>VLIW architectures are generally statically scheduled, where each instruction contains multiple scalar operations. They generally don't do hazard detection or even full data forwarding, instead relying on the compiler to schedule operations in a good way.</p>
<p>The advantage of VLIW architectures is that the compiler gets more control over the scheduling and how different functional units (FPUs, ALUs, etc.) are used, so we can devote more transistors to the actual functional units themselves, rather than hazard detection and so on.</p>
<p>Consider a VLIW architecture where each instruction contains two memory operations, two floating point operations, and one ALU/branch operation. Each operation can have its own pipeline, so we'll give memory operations the usual fetch/decode/execute/memory/writeback, floating point operations a fetch/decode/execute 1/execute 2/execute 3/writeback pipeline, and ALU/branch operations a fetch/decode/execute/writeback pipeline. We'll also say branches resolve in the decode stage for all types of operation, so we need 1 branch delay slot (since decode is 1 pipeline stage after fetch).</p>
<p>Fetches occur at the same time for every pipeline - one instruction is fetched for every cycle.</p>
<p>Assuming full data forwarding is implemented, the latency of memory operations could be up to 1 if the execute stage has a dependency on the memory stage, the latency of ALU/branch operations could be up to 1 if the decode stage has a dependency on the execute stage, and the latency of floating point operations could be up to 2 if the execute 1 stage has a dependency on the execute 3 stage.</p>
<p><strong>Slot utilization</strong> is how well the available operation slots for each instructions are filled, defined as <span class="math inline">\frac{\text{slots filled}}{\text{number of instructions} \times \text{slots per instruction}}</span>.</p>

<p>;wip: global scheduling, software pipelining, catch up on the rest, gotta run for interviews</p>
<h1 id="section-9">2/1/17</h1>
<p>VLIW processors have many techniques for improving throughput and parallelism.</p>
<p><strong>Speculative execution</strong> is basically just when we keep executing down the predicted path when we reach a branch, regardless of whether that path is actually taken or not, and then undoing the effects of that if we don't end up taking the predicted path. Implemented correctly, it eliminates branch delays when the branch predictor is right.</p>
<p><strong>Speculative loading</strong> is a technique in which the compiler tries to move memory load instructions upward to avoid memory latency, even if they possibly won't be needed, like if a branch isn't taken.</p>
<p>In the IA-64 architecture, the Advanced Load Address Table (ALAT) is a unit of bidirectional associative memory used to implement speculative loading.</p>
<p>In IA-64, we denote speculative instructions with the <code>.s</code> suffix - <code>ld8.s</code> is the speculative version of <code>ld8</code>. We denote an advanced load version of the load instruction with the <code>lw8.a</code> suffix, and the ALAT check version of loads with <code>lw8.c</code>. Each <code>lw8.a</code> instruction is paired up with a <code>lw8.c</code> instruction later on - the <code>lw8.a</code> instruction starts the actual data transfer into the ALAT, and then when the corresponding <code>lw8.c</code> instruction is encountered, we can just load it from the ALAT rather than making a trip all the way to memory. Cache entries are invalidated if their addresses are stored to in between those instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Deferred exceptions</strong> are a technique for making speculative execution easier. If we want to hoist an instruction above a conditional branch, and the exception causes an exception at runtime, we need a way to mark the instruction in a way that the exceptions are only handled if the conditional branch isn't taken, in order to make sure the hoisted code works the same as the original.</p>
<p>Consider a <code>LW R1, (R5)</code> instruction, which gets hoisted above a <code>BEQZ R4, L1</code> instrucion. To implement deferred exceptions, we can add a poison bit to each register, and if and only if the speculatively executed instruction raises an exception, we can set the poison bit instead. Then, when we reach the original instruction, we can check for the poison bit being set, and if it is, actually raise the exception there.</p>
<p>;wip: read textbook section 3.5.6</p>
<p><strong>Predicated execution</strong> is a technique in which instructoins only commit their results if some predicate is true. This is useful because we can often avoid branches and use predicates instead, therefore avoiding branch delays. IA-64, for example, has 64 1-bit predicate registers, which can be set by various operations like comparison, and used to enable/disable different instructions.</p>
<p>Predicated execution essentially lets the compiler turn control dependencies into data dependencies, by letting it change branches into predicated instructions. All of the instructions run, but only the ones with true predicates will actually have an effect. It's very useful when we have lots of small basic blocks.</p>
<p>For example, in IA-64, we can denote <code>p1 = r1 == 0; p2 = r1 !== 0</code> as <code>cmp.eq p1, p2 = 0, r1;;</code>, where <code>p1</code> to <code>p64</code> are the predicate registers. Then, we can do <code>(p1) add r4 = r4, 1</code> to increment <code>r4</code> if and only if predicate register <code>p1</code> is 1.</p>
<p>The Itanium architecture, IA-64, was also called an EPIC architecture (explicitly parallel instruction computing - VLIW with data forwarding and dynamic events like cache misses). It has 128 65-bit (64 bits, plus a poison bit, called the Not-A-Thing bit) integer registers, 128 82-bit floating point registers, and 64 1-bit predicate registers.</p>

<h2 id="out-of-order-pipelines">Out of order pipelines</h2>
<p>Out of order pipelines dyanmically schedule instructions. The benefit is that they can take advantage of instruction-level parallelism not available at compile time, and allow us to make compilers a lot simpler, at the expense of more complicated CPUs.</p>
<p>When we're designing these pipelines, we need to design around hazards in register data, memory data, and control flow.</p>
<p>Out of order execution is inherently superscalar - there's no point in doing dynamic scheduling unless we have multiple functional units.</p>
<p>Scheduling is usually done using Tomasulo's algorithm, an improved version of previous techniques like scoreboarding. It was invented around 1967 and used for an IBM FPU.</p>
<p>Tomasulo's FPU has two functional units - a 2-stage pipelined, 2-cycle floating point adder, and a non-pipelined, 3-cycle floating point multiplier. The adder has 3 <strong>reservation stations</strong>, and the multiplier has 2.</p>
<p>The FPU also has 3 sets of registers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Float Registers (FLR) F0, F2, F4, F6 are the floating point registers used for FPU computation.</li>
<li>Float Load Buffer (FLB) stores 6 operands read from memory.</li>
<li>Store Data Buffer (SDB) stores 3 results to be written to memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>common data bus</strong> allows parts of the FPU to broadcast a float along with a 4-bit source tag to specify where it came from (like a reservation station or the FLB).</p>
<p>Units like reservation stations, the FLR, and the SDB hold data and the data's tag.</p>
<p>The key concept here is the reservation station, and the use of tags to</p>
<p>Here's the FPU's workflow:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Up to two instructions are dispatched (in their original order) to the reservation station.</li>
<li>Operands are copied to the reservation station.</li>
<li>The destination register number is compared to the reservation station number.</li>
<li>Instructions are sent to the functional unit (adder or multiplier) when all of its operands are ready and the functional unit is free.</li>
<li>After computing the result, the functional broadcasts the result on the CDB, and waiting units like the FLR, reservation stations, and SDB update their contents.</li>
</ol>
<p>;wip: what even is this, read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomasulo_algorithm#Implementation_concepts</p>
<p>Tomasulo's algorithm has imprecise exceptions. For example, if register F4 is renamed by instruction X in cycle 1 and renamed by instruction Y in cycle 2, then W never writes its result to register F4, so if W faults, then recovery isn't possible since the semantics require the result be written. There's no real way to recover from this except to restart the computation from an earlier point.</p>
<p>An out of order pipeline looks something like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fetch - retrieve multiple instructions per cycle (in order).</li>
<li>Decode - identify instruction boundaries, opcodes, operands (in order).
<ul>
<li>For Intel x86 processors, CISC instructions are translated into internal RISC instructions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Dispatch - send the decoded instructions off to the reservation stations (in order).</li>
<li>Issue - send instructions from reservation stations to the execution units (out of order).</li>
<li>Finish - broadcast result in the forwarding bus (out of order).</li>
<li>Commit - update destination registers in order (in order).</li>
<li>Retire - update memory-store instructions (in order).
<ul>
<li>This is where SW instructions actually take effect.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>re-order buffer</strong> (ROB) remembers program order, so we can put things back in order after the Issue stage. At the dispatch stage, each instruction gets an entry in the ROB. At the finish stage, the ROB entry is updated to ;wip. At the Commit stage, the ROB entry is removed.</p>
<p>The ROB also keeps track of which instructions raise exceptions, so we can handle them at the Commit stage of the pipeline (this is analogous to the Itanium case, where we used a poison bit to only raise exceptions when we reach the Writeback stage). This ensures that the processor state is correct/precise at the instruction that raised the exception, which allows us to recover from the exception.</p>
<p>The width of an out of order pipeline is the number of instructions dispatched/committed per cycle.</p>
<h1 id="section-11">9/2/17</h1>
<p>Assignment 1 (not project 1) is due after reading week. It's about scheduling instructions in a pipelined processor.</p>
<h3 id="register-renamingassignment">Register renaming/assignment</h3>
<p>Data dependencies within a block of code form a data-flow graph (DFG) in the processor, where each edge <span class="math inline">a \to b</span> represents the fact that <span class="math inline">b</span> depends on the result of <span class="math inline">a</span>, so <span class="math inline">b</span> shouldn't run before <span class="math inline">a</span>. To help us run Tomasulo's algorithm, we can draw out the DFG and arrange it to minimize height.</p>
<p>The longest path (also known as the critical path) within the dataflow graph is the minimum number of cycles we can execute those instructions in - this is called the <strong>dataflow limit</strong>. In other words, with one thread, it's impossible to execute faster than the length of the critical path of true dependencies.</p>
<p>Operations in the CPU produce values, which are then assigned to registers. The <strong>live range</strong> of a value is the range within the code starting from when the value is first written to a register, up to and including the last use (when the value is last read from the register).</p>
<p>DFGs can also have virtual dependencies between pairs of instructions, called <strong>false dependencies</strong>, which give us write-after-read or write-after-write hazards if we change the order of those instructions.</p>
<p>Since there are a limited number of registers, the compiler needs to recycle registers - the compiler can use a register for a new value after the current value has been read for the last time. However, reusing registers imposes write-after-read dependencies.</p>
<p><strong>Register renaming</strong> is a technique that tries to get rid of false data dependencies (i.e., write-after-read hazards), which helps us get better parallelism. Essentially, we're renaming the register that we're reading so that the write becomes independent of the read, allowing us to execute both in parallel.</p>
<p>To implement this, each operation's output value is assigned to a temporary <strong>rename register</strong> within a rename register file. The actual destination register is associated with the rename register ID, and on the commit step, we can actually copy the value from the rename register to the destination register. If we have enough rename registers, we can essentially have single assignment for each register, eliminating false dependencies and allowing us to improve parallelism.</p>
<p>Register renaming is used by Tomasulo's algorithm.</p>
<p>In hardware, we have an <strong>ARF</strong> (architected register file), which maps architecture registers (R0-R31 in MIPS) to rename registers. The <strong>RRF</strong> (rename register file) has one entry for each ROB entry, and the</p>
<p>With ;wip, we replace the ARF with an RAT (register alias table), which maps registers R0-R31 to architected and rename register entries in the PRF. The RAT has two columns - the retirement RAT (which has indices of architected register in the PRF), and the front-end RAT (which points to renamed register indices in the PRF). In case of an exception, the retirement RAT is copied to the front-end RAT, which undoes any renames done by the instructions after the fault, allowing us to raise precise exceptions.</p>
<p>;wip: read textbook section 3.4.6 (or 5.3? dunno what the numbers mean) and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_renaming</p>
<p>The PRF (physical register file) stores the actual contents of the architected and rename registers. The</p>
<p>Here's what this looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>During dispatch:
<ul>
<li>Allocate an ROB entry</li>
<li>Allocate a reservation station entry</li>
<li>Rename the destination register of the operation in the PRF and RAT.</li>
<li>Copy operands from PRF (using front-end RAT) to reservation station (the values of the operands if the data is available, or the register number if not)</li>
<li>Rename the front-end RAT with the rename register number.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On commit:
<ul>
<li>Update the retirement RAT.</li>
<li>Add the old PRF number to the PRF free list.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Delayed read</strong> is a technique in which the reservation station only stored the operand tag and status of the data, rather than the data itself, reducing data duplication. It can also time instruction issuing to correspond with the broadcast of the result of the operation it depends on. ;wip: what</p>
<h1 id="section-12">14/2/17</h1>
<p>Register renaming is a technique for undoing the hazards caused by register recycling.</p>
<p>Speculative execution is a technique in which we predict the direction of a branch and start executing that path while the branch is being resolved. However, this presents issues for register renaming, because speculatively executed instructions need to rename registers too - we must make sure the effects of the renaming are undone if the branch turns out to be wrong. To do this, we can do either rollbacks or checkpointing.</p>
<p>To do rollbacks, we save frontend RAT entries into the ROB (reorder buffer) as soon as the speculative instruction is dispatched. To recover upon a mispredicted branch, we can copy back the rename register number from the ROB to the frontend RAT, one at a time, until the branch instruction is actually completed. This works, but it's quite slow because of all the copying we have to do over multiple cycles.</p>
<p>To do checkpointing, we save a full copy of the entire frontend RAT as soon as the speculative instruction is dispatched. The saved copy of the frontend RAT is copied back to the frontend RAT is copied back if we mispredict the branch. This can be a lot faster than rollbacks, but it requires more storage and hardware to support this, depending on how many branches we are speculating past.</p>
<p>For Intel Skylake chips, we have 224 ROB entries, 180-entry integer PRF, and 168-entry floating point PRF. Haswell chips support up to 48 checkpoints - the ability to speculatively execute 48 branches at once!</p>
<h2 id="memory-data-flow">Memory Data Flow</h2>
<p>Data in memory includes the data segments, stack, and heap. Loads usually start a chain of instructions, because they have to wait on RAM, which is slow compared to processors. How do these work with pipelined processors?</p>
<p>For store instructions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Upon dispatch, calculate the effective address and store it with the data in the <strong>store buffer</strong> (SB).</li>
<li>After commit, write the store buffer entry out to the processor cache (so it gets written to RAM).</li>
</ol>
<p>For load instructions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Upon dispatch, calculate the effective address, and read the data from either the store buffer (if available) or the processor cache (so it gets read from RAM).</li>
<li>After commit, broadcast the destination read on the forwarding bus, so the other units know that the destination register has been updated.</li>
</ol>
<p>We want to be able to issue store instructions out of order, to improve performance.</p>
<p>Speculative loads are loads performed under the assumption that they are unaliased to recent stores - loads that are done from the cache, not the store buffer. When we do speculative loads, we need to detect if the load gave a valid result, and if not, retry it.</p>
<p>The speculative load process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Upon dispatch, calculate the effective address. If a committed store is in the store buffer, forward the data along the forwarding bus. Otherwise, get the data from the processor cache. Add the speculative load's location and effective address to the FLB (finished load buffer).</li>
<li>After commit, remove the created entry from the FLB.</li>
</ol>
<p>The store process, when using speculative loads, becomes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Upon dispatch, calculate the effective address and store it with the data in the store buffer.</li>
<li>Upon commit, if aliased loads are present in the FLB, suppress those speculative loads. Write the store buffer entry out to the processor cache (so it gets written to RAM).</li>
</ol>
<p>This ensures that if a speculative load finishes before a store completes, the effect of the load gets undone.</p>
<p>Another technique for speeding up loads is <strong>data prefetching</strong>, where data gets loaded from RAM into the processor data cache before it's actually loaded, so when we actually load it, we can do so directly from the cache. For example, in AMD64 the the <code>prefetch</code> instruction does this.</p>
<p>Data prefetching can also be done automatically - hardware prefetchers might detect patterns of sequential access, strided access (access with a linear offset each time, like accessing the diagonals of a matrix or accessing the columns of a row-major ordered matrix). One downside of this is that it might bring in data we don't actually want, reducing cache hit rate. Some systems like SPARC have a separate cache for prefetched data, called the prefetch buffer, to avoid this issue.</p>
<h1 id="section-13">16/2/17</h1>
<p>Review of caching and memory (see ECE222 notes for more details):</p>
<ul>
<li>Memory and caches are organized into fixed-sized lines/blocks, of the same size between main memory and caches.</li>
<li>Cache lines store the tag (the other bits of the address, enough to reconstruct the address later), the flags (dirty, valid, etc.), and the data itself.</li>
<li>Direct-mapped caching: blocks of memory are mapped to cache lines according to their block index modulo the number of blocks.</li>
<li>Fully-associative caching: blocks of memory are mapped to cache lines in an LRU fashion, and associative memory allows lookup by block index.</li>
<li>Set-associative: the first few bits of the block index are used to determine which set of cache lines to map to, and each set of cache lines forms a fully associative cache (fully-associative caching can be thought of as 1-way set-associative caching, and direct-mapped caching can be thought of as all-way set-associative caching). Most instruction/data caches work best in practice at around 8-way set associative caching.</li>
<li>Three types of cache misses: compulsory (data has never been in the cache before), capacity (cache is too small to hold the data, so we kicked the data we needed earlier), conflict (the associativity is too low).</li>
<li>Suppose we have 32-bit addresses, and 1024 direct-mapped 64-byte cache lines. Then the first 16 bits of the address are stored as tags, the next 10 bits are used as the block index (because taking the bits before the block offset modulo 1024 is the same as just taking the last 10 bits), and the last 6 bits are for the offset within the block (addresses point to individual bytes).</li>
<li>Virtual memory provides protection against other processes modifying a given process' memory, and allows processes to work with a larger, virtual address space.</li>
<li>The MMU translates virtual to physical addresses. It translates the virtual page number to the physical segment number, and keeps the offset bits.</li>
<li>The MMU can use multiple different indexing modes:
<ul>
<li>PI/PT indexing (physical indexing, physical tagging) - MMU entries are indexed and tagged by physical addresses, which means translation from virtual to physical address completes before cache lookup starts - this is easy to implement but slow.</li>
<li>VI/PT indexing (virtual indexing, physical tagging) - MMU entries are indexed by virtual addresses but tagged by physical addresses, which means translation and cache lookup can occur in parallel. However, VI/PT results in the synonym problem, where physical blocks are cached in the MMU multiple times for shared memory, since each physical address can have a different virtual address for different processes. To solve this, the OS can do page colouring to make sure the virtual page number is always the same in all virtual address spaces. This is widely used in practice.</li>
<li>VI/VT (virtual indexing, virtual tagging) - MMU entries are indexed and tagged by virtual addresses, which means we only need to translate virtual page numbers to physical page numbers upon cache misses. This also has the synonym problem, but it also has the homonym problem, where the same virtual tag can refer to different possible physical blocks. OSs solve this by storing the process ID in the tag. This is rarely used in practice.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Intel's main competitive advantage nowadays is its superior branch prediction abilities.</p>
<p>In MIPS, control flow happens either as a branch instruction (which does PC-relative addressing), or as a jump (which does indirect addressing).</p>
<p>Speculative execution has three main concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Target speculation:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>branch target buffer</strong> maps branch instruction addresses to branch target addresses. It can also store branch predictors by the address of the branch instruction that it predicts the target of, but we often use a separate <strong>pattern history table</strong> (PHT) that stores branch predictors, directly indexed by the lower-order bits of the address of the branch instruction (aliasing is possible, but that's fine for our use case).</li>
<li>In the fetch stage for a branch instruction, if the branch target buffer has an entry for the address of this branch instruction, we load the branch target address into PC, giving us a 0-latency branch.</li>
<li>In the execute stage, the branch unit actually resolves the branch to validate whether the prediction is correct or not. If it correct, we can add/update the branch target buffer entry, or remove the branch target buffer entry if it wasn't correct (to delete the prediction).</li>
<li>This works well for branches, but not really for jumps, which use indirect addressing. For example, returning from a subroutine called from many places means that the branch target address will often change, causing frequent branch mispredictions.</li>
</ul></li>

<p>;wip: missed due to interviews</p>
<p>;wip: out of order pipelines: condition spec (section 8), dynamic methods based on branch history, adding a pattern history table to the BTB (branch target buffer)</p>
<h1 id="section-15">2/3/17</h1>
<p>The branch predictors we'll look at are 2-bit saturating counters, like one of the questions in Project Part 1. Whenever we take a branch, we increment the counter, and whenever we don't, we decrement. The counter saturating means that incrementing 11 stays at 11, and decrementing 00 stays at 00. The branch is predicted to be taken whenever the counter is 10 or 11. Branch predictors are added to the PHT whenever we encounter a branch instruction. They're initialized to 10 (&quot;weakly taken&quot;).</p>
<p>Nair conducted a study in 1995 to check on how accurate branch prediction is in the real world, and found that prediction accuracy was 85%+ on many commonly used programs like SPICE and GCC. This is actually within 1% of an optimal 4-state branch predictor FSM, so saturating 2-bit counters are actually really good at predicting branches in real-world situations (they tried every one of the 5248 possible 4-state branch predicting FSMs!). They also looked at saturating counters with a different number of bits, and aliasing vs. the number of low-order bits we index by in the PHT, and characterized performance as those variables were changed.</p>
<p>;wip: correlating predictors, section 8.2.3, bimodal vs local vs global predictors</p>
<p>A <strong>bimodal branch predictor</strong> is the kind we've been looking at so far - the PHT is indexed by some subset of the bits of PC. This works decently well, but it doesn't capture behaviour like alternating branches (the branch switches between taken and not taken every time we execute), or similar patterns in branching.</p>
<p>A <strong>local branch predictor</strong> tries to capture this. To predict a branch, we index some bits of the branch instruction address (the value of PC) into a history table, which stores the corresponding last <span class="math inline">k</span> branch results (for example, 10110 means the branch instruction branched 3 times out of the last 5 executions). Then, those last <span class="math inline">k</span> results are XORed with a subset of bits of the branch instruction address, and the result is used as indices in the PHT, which stores the usual 2-bit saturating counters. In other words, <span class="math inline">\text{prediction} = \text{saturating\_counter\_prediction}(\text{subset of bits of PC} \oplus \text{PHT}[\text{history}[\text{another subset of bits of PC}]])</span>. This allows us to predict based on the history of branch results for individual branch instructions, and it works really well in practice.</p>
<p>A <strong>global branch predictor</strong> detects correlated behaviour (like two different branch instructions that only branch when the other doesn't), saves the last <span class="math inline">n</span> branch decisions of any branch instructions in a global history register (GR), a plain register that stores historical data for all branches. The global history register is used as indices in the PHT - we can look up our 2-bit saturating counters in the PHT by the history of all branches. Turns out that this doesn't work as well as local branch prediction, mostly because of aliasing - global history often looks the same for a lot of different branch instructions that behave very differently. In other words, <span class="math inline">\text{prediction} = \text{saturating\_counter\_prediction}(\text{PHT}[\text{history of last } k \text{ branches}])</span>.</p>
<p>Real-world systems often combine a global and bimodal branch predictor, indexing into the PHT based on the global history XORed with some subset of the bits of PC. This scheme is what gshare uses, and performs almost as accurately as local branch prediction in real-world uses. However, it has one less level of indirection compared to local predictors (local predictors have to look up a value in history and then PHT, while we only have to look up a value in the PHT), so it can be faster.</p>
<p>Some processors implement meta branch predictors - running different types of branch predictors in parallel, and changing the one used based on their previous performance for each particular branch instruction.</p>
<h1 id="section-16">7/3/17</h1>
<p>Branch prediction examples, step by step. In the diagram, branch results are shifted into the right side of the history entries.</p>
<p>A branch predictor needs to both predict branches, check the results of those branches after they're resolved/executed, and then update the predictors based on that information. When the predictor predicts wrong and we're speculatively executing, we must also rollback the effects of the execution and restart it at the correct address.</p>
<p>To implement this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each branch instruction is assigned a tag bit index (e.g., bit 4 or bit 2).</li>
<li>Each instruction has a set of tag bits that represent whether it's being speculatively executed for a given tag (e.g., a tag of 0101 means the instruction is speculatively executing for the branch with tag bit index 0 and tag bit index 2). The tag bits are set when the instruction is being dispatched to the reservation stations.</li>
<li>When a branch is resolved, the tag bits and the result of the branch are broadcast:
<ul>
<li>If the prediction was correct, instructions with the branch instruction's tag bit index set in their tag bits have that bit cleared (e.g., if a branch with tag bit index 2 resolves correctly, we clear bit 2 of te tag bits of all instructions).</li>
<li>If the prediction was not correct, instructions with the bit in the tag bits at the tag bit index set are cancelled, the ROB tail pointer is moved back to the branch instruction, and the frontend RAT checkpoint is restored.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thread-level-parallelism">Thread Level Parallelism</h2>
<p>Parallel programming allows us to execute multiple things at the same time on multiple processors. Generally this is done by using shared memory (pthreads, etc.) or message passing between processes (MPI, Scala, etc.). In this course we'll look mainly at the shared memory model.</p>
<p>For our purposes, processes are collections of threads with an address space.</p>
<p>A critical section is code that accesses shared data. We want only one thread to be executing a critical section at a time, and we usually enforce this using locks. In CS350 we looked at the software side of implementing these syncrhonization primitives, but now we'll look at the hardware primitives that allow us to implement these operations.</p>
<p>Common schemes for hardware synchronization from CS350:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compare-and-swap - atomically load some memory, compare it to a given value, and conditionally store it back (e.g., <code>CMPXCHG</code> in x86).</li>
<li>Fetch-and-add - atomically load some memory, add a value to it, and store it back (e.g., <code>fetchadd4</code> in IA64).</li>
<li>Load-linked/store-conditional - use load-linked to load some memory, then store-conditional tries to store, failing if the linked location was changed since we load-linked it or if there was an interrupt (e.g., <code>LL</code>/<code>SC</code> in MIPS).</li>
</ul>
<p>With any of these, we can implement a spinlock, the basic primitive needed to implement all of the other synchronization primitive. For example, with the compare-and-swap primitive <code>cmpswp</code> in MIPS:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode asm"><code class="sourceCode fasm"><span class="fu">spin:</span> cmpswp LOCK_VARIABLE, <span class="dv">0</span>, <span class="dv">1</span> <span class="co">; if LOCK_VARIABLE is 0, set it to 1</span>
      bne spin <span class="co">; loop until we successfully set LOCK_VARIABLE to 1 from 0</span>
      <span class="co">; we now hold the spinlock, and can do our critical section stuff</span>
      sw R0, LOCK_VARIABLE <span class="co">; release the lock</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Another example, with the <code>ll</code>/<code>sc</code> primitives in MIPS:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode asm"><code class="sourceCode fasm"><span class="fu">spin:</span> ll R1, ADDRESS
      addi R1, R1, <span class="dv">1</span>
      <span class="co">;wip: where&#39;s the critical section?</span>
      sc R1, A
      bne spin </code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Symmetric multiprocessing</strong> (SMP) describes a shared memory multiprocessor architecture with <strong>uniform memory access</strong> (every processor can access every memory location with the same access time).</p>
<p>To implement uniform memory access times, we might put processors and memory modules on a shared bus (memory accesses are broadcasted on the bus), or use a crossbar switch (access to memory banks routed by processor).</p>
<p>SMP systems tend to have limited scalability, topping out at a few tens of processors, because of the need for uniform memory access.</p>
<p><strong>Non-uniform memory access</strong> (NUMA) is the opposite of UMA architectures - they allow processors to have different access times to different memory locations. This allows us to scale them up a lot more (e.g., IBM Blue Gene has over 65000 nodes!).</p>
<p>To implement non-uniform memory access times, we might use a scalable interconnect system like a tree network (heirarchy of nodes), mesh networks (nodes connect to adjacent nodes, like on a grid), torus networks (nodes connected in a grid that wraps around), hypercube networks (nodes connected with every node with a binary ID that differs by 1 bit), and so on.</p>
<p>In a NUMA architecture, we must ensure that the memory stays coherent. Coherent shared memory means that all processors will see the most recent write to any memory location (i.e., cache coherency for memory). This can be implemented by broadcasting writes on the memory bus (write-through caching), or by broadcasting invalidation messages on the bus, so future reads to that memory location will request its updated value (write-back caching).</p>
<p>One way to do ensure cache coherency in UMA architectures is the MESI (Modified Exclusive Shared Invalid) protocol. In this protocol, caches are divided into blocks, and each cache block is either:</p>
<ul>
<li>MODIFIED: local value is different from value in main memory (dirty), and this is the only copy (the copy of the data in main memory is stale).
<ul>
<li>Upon a local read/write request for the block, we can just directly read/write the value in the cache - it's the only fresh copy.</li>
<li>Upon a remote READ request for the block, we make the block SHARED, perform the writeback to main memory, and then respond with a DIRTY snoop message to tell the requester its copy is definitely stale.</li>
<li>Upon a remote WRITE request for the block, we make the block INVALID, perform the writeback to main memory, and then respond with a DIRTY snoop message to tell the requester it's modifying a stale copy.</li>
<li>When the cache needs to evict the block from the cache, it performs the writeback to main memory and makes the block INVALID.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>EXCLUSIVE: local value is same as value in main memory (clean), and this is the only copy (the copy of the data in main memory is fresh).
<ul>
<li>Upon a local read request for the block, we can just directly read the value in the cache.</li>
<li>Upon a local write request for the block, we make the block MODIFIED and write the new value - it's now different from main memory.</li>
<li>Upon a remote READ request for the block, we make the block SHARED, and then respond with a SHARED snoop message to tell the requester there is already a fresh copy of the data.</li>
<li>Upon a remote WRITE request for the block, we make the block INVALID - our cache's copy is now out of date.</li>
<li>When the cache needs to evict the block from the cache, it sets the block to INVALID (no need for writeback, since the main memory is already up to date).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>SHARED: local value is same as value in main memory (clean), and there are fresh copies in other caches.
<ul>
<li>Upon a local read request for the block, we can just directly read the value in the cache - it's known to be fresh.</li>
<li>Upon a local write request for the block, we can make the block MODIFIED and write the new value, then broadcast a remote WRITE request for the block (in this context the WRITE request is also often called a UPGRADE request).</li>
<li>Upon a remote READ request for the block, we respond with a SHARED message to tell the requester there are already fresh copies of the data.</li>
<li>Upon a remote WRITE request for the block, we make the block INVALID - our cache's copy is now out of date.</li>
<li>When the cache needs to evict the block from the cache, it sets the block to INVALID (no need for writeback, since the main memory is already up to date).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>INVALID: local value is different from value in main memory (dirty), and there may be copies in other caches (the copy of the data in main memory is stale).
<ul>
<li>To read from this block, the processor broadcasts a remote READ request to get the data from main memory, and makes the block SHARED if there are other copies (if we receive a SHARED message for the block from another cache after making the request), or EXCLUSIVE otherwise.</li>
<li>To write to this block, we can change the value and make the block MODIFIED (since it's now different from main memory), then broadcast a remote WRITE request to invalidate the block's values in other caches.</li>
<li>READ/WRITE bus messages are ignored - the block is stale anyways.</li>
<li>When the cache needs to evict the block from the cache, it sets the block to INVALID (no need for writeback, since the block is stale anyways).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Since all the memory messages are on the bus, the MESI protocol lets us store all the cache block states in a <strong>cache tag array</strong>, which replaces all the dirty bits and status bits. The cache controller is responsible for monitoring the bus and keeping the cache tag array up to date.</p>
<p>MESI transactions occur on <strong>local requests</strong> (requests from a processor to its own cache to read/write data) and on <strong>remote requests/bus requests</strong> (requests from other processors to their own caches, that we're just listening in on).</p>
<p>A <strong>snooping implementation</strong> means that every cache is listening to bus traffic from every other cache - they're snooping on each other's bus traffic. The snooping implementation allows caches to update their own states depending on changes in other caches, or tell other caches whether they've got a fresh copy of the data they're reading/writing.</p>
<h1 id="section-18">14/3/17</h1>
<p>Tips about project part 3: make sure to copy the <code>.x</code> files into the project folder.</p>
<p>MESI is a snooping protocol, which means that processor caches are both listening to requests from the processor, and snooping on traffic generated by other processors on the bus.</p>
<p>Suppose we have processors P1, P2, P3, all sharing one block B1 of memory. P1 writes to B1, then P2 reads from B1. In a MESI system, this shows up as:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Initially, B1's corresponding cache entries for each processor are all in the SHARED state.</li>
<li>P1 writes to B1, which sends out a P1 upgrade message on the bus. This sets P1's cache entry for B1 to MODIFIED, and P2 and P3's cache entry for B1 to INVALID.</li>
<li>P2 reads B1, and since P2's cache entry is INVALID, P2 doesn't do anything. However, P1 gives a snoop response of DIRTY and performs a writeback. This sets all cache entries for B1 to SHARED again.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to MESI, there's also MSI, which implements cache coherency without the EXCLUSIVE state, folding it into the SHARED state instead (it's a bit less efficient because local writes have to send out the UPGRADE message). MESIF and MOESI are other variants, based on the idea that when there's a cache miss, it's faster for another cache to supply the value than for the main memory to.</p>
<p>MOESI is used by ARM and ARM, and is a probing protocol rather than a snooping protocol - processors can directly ask other processors for data. Basically, this just adds an OWNED state, which means there's only one copy of the cache that serves this particular block. If a processor's cache holds a MODIFIED block and another processor does a bus read, the first one's block becomes an OWNED block, and the first processor forwards the block to the requesting processor. Likewise, bus writes modify the owner's and the writer's copy. The owner of the block simply does the writeback before evicting the block from its cache. MOESI is nice because it reduces writebacks to main memory.</p>
<p>MESIF is used by Intel, and is another probing protocol. Basically, this just adds a FORWARDING state, . For a SHARED block, only one of those holders of that SHARED block should forward the block when there's a READ/WRITE on the bus. The most recent reader of a block holds it in the FORWARDING state and does the forwarding. After responding to a bus READ/WRITE, it transitions to the SHARED state (the requesting processor now has the FORWARDING block). This is nice because it makes caches take turns forwarding the data. Also, the FORWARDING block has the freshest copy of the block's data, so it's not likely to evict that block (which would be slow due to needing to write back to main memory).</p>
<h1 id="section-19">16/3/17</h1>
<p>To implement spinlocks with the atomic exchange instruction:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode asm"><code class="sourceCode fasm">     daddui R2, R0, <span class="dv">1</span> <span class="co">; set R2 to 1</span>
spin exch R2, (R1) <span class="co">; atomically exhange the value of the lock with 1</span>
     bnez R2, spin <span class="co">; if the lock was originally held (originally had a value of 1), keep spinning</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>exch</code> is atomic, so it always generates a write miss (which then causes other lock holders to do writebacks) - this is a lot of bus traffic. This is because the last holder of the lock has the lock value as MODIFIED in memory, and the rest has it as an INVALID value, and this switches every time there's an EXCH instruction.</p>
<p>What we really want is for the lock to be a SHARED value between all the nodes trying to get the lock, at least most of the time. We can implement this by non-atomically reading the value first before trying to atomically exchange it:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode asm"><code class="sourceCode fasm">spin ld R2, (R1)
     bnez R2, spin
     daddui R2, R0, <span class="dv">1</span>
     exch R2, (R1)
     bnez R2, spin</code></pre></div>
<p>The non-atomic read causes a read miss rather than a write miss, and makes the node with the MODIFIED lock value and the node that caused the read miss to change their lock value to SHARED. After the read miss is resolved (so the lock value becomes SHARED), nodes can now spin on their local cache values. When the lock holder releases the lock, the lock value is invalidated in the other nodes, allowing them to race to try to acquire that lock.</p>
<p>A directory implementation of MESI has a directory that stores the state of each block of memory, stored with each memory block. Each directory is a buffer with one entry per block, each entry storing:</p>
<ul>
<li>The block number corresponding to the entry.</li>
<li>A bit representing whether the block is modified.</li>
<li>A sharing vector - a sequence of <span class="math inline">n</span> bits (where <span class="math inline">n</span> is the number of nodes) representing which nodes have an up-to-date copy of the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this doesn't explicitly represent the EXCLUSIVE state - this is because EXCLUSIVE is simply a SHARED state where only 1 of the sharing vector bits is set.</p>
<p>The directory adds overhead for each block, specifically <span class="math inline">\frac{\text{directory row or entry size}}{\text{block size}}</span>. The general architecture is that each processor is connected to a memory and a directory, and these three are all connected to a scalable interconnect.</p>
<p>A directory implementation is comparable to a snooping implementation - it's faster and has less bus traffic, but it adds a significant amount of overhead to actually track the memory states.</p>
<p>Suppose P1 writes a piece of data, originally SHARED between P1 and P2. P1 must then send an UPGRADE to directory 1 to make P1 the owner of that data, then directory 1 sends INVALIDATE to the rest of the processors that have a copy of the data. P1 is now</p>
<p>When P2 reads after the above happens, P2 sends a READ MISS to directory 1, then directory 1 sends a FETCH to P1. P1 sends a WRITEBACK to directory 1 to make sure it has the most recent data. Then, directory 1 sends a DATA REPLY to P2, completing the read.</p>
<h2 id="multi-level-caching">Multi-level caching</h2>
<p>There are two schemes for multi-level caching:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inclusive: data in faster/higher levels (like L1) is a subset of data in slower/lower levels (like L2, L3). Fetches in higher levels are also fetched into lower levels. In other words, data is always replicated.</li>
<li>Exclusive: cache levels don't replicate data.</li>
<li>Non-inclusive: data might be replicated, or it might not be.</li>
</ul>
<p>In inclusive cache schemes, only the lowest level of cache maintains cache coherency. Remote UPGRADE/WRITE-MISS messages are passed up to higher levels, while local UPGRADE/WRITE-MISS messages are passed to lower levels, sort of like a write-through scheme. This has the advantage of higher levels dealing with most processor requests.</p>
<p>In exclusive cache schemes, all levels need to snoop on UPGRADE/WRITE-MISS messages, and for a directory, messages go to all levels.</p>
<p>In current Intel architectures, L1 and L2 are exclusive caches, and L3 is inclusive.</p>
<h1 id="section-20">21/3/17</h1>
<h2 id="hardware-transactional-memory">Hardware Transactional Memory</h2>
<p>Transactional memory allows memory operations to be organized into transactions, much like database transactions. Compared to locks, it's a simpler paradigm and is easier to reason about.</p>
<p>There are some research implementations of software transactional memory, but they generally result in poor performance. Hardware implementations can be a lot faster</p>
<p>For our purposes, a <strong>transaction</strong> is a set of instructions that either all succeed (runs normally), or none do (all those instructions have no effect). In other words, an atomic block of instructions. Our goal is to allow transactions to execute in parallel.</p>
<p>Reads in transactions are tracked in the <strong>read set</strong> (RS) buffer, and writes are tracked in the <strong>write set</strong> (WS) buffer (reads/writes aren't actually executed, just tracked). A <strong>conflict</strong> is when a thread writes to a memory location that is in another transaction's RS or WS.</p>
<p>Locks are pessimistic parallism - they optimize for the case in which a conflict occurs, by preventing conflicts from happening in the first place. Transactions are optimistic parallelism - they optimize for the case in which no conflicts occur, by recovering from conflicts when we encounter them.</p>

<p>This compiles with experimental features of GCC, which implements software transactional memory. However, without hardware support, this turns out to have half the performance of the mutex-based version. The main issue is that resolving conflicts is really expensive in hardware.</p>
<p>Herlihy and Moss proposed the first hardware transactional memory architecture in 1993. This architecture added a transactional cache in parallel to the L1 data cache, and improved performance over software transactional memory by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>The first commercially available hardware transactional memory implementation was the IBM POWER8 in 2013, followed by the Intel Haswell chips later that year. The POWER8 processor's HTM implementation was complicated by its cache structure, and the fact that it had 8 hardware threads per core.</p>
<p>A typical implementation of HTM looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>tbegin FALLBACK_ADDRESS</code> instruction to start a transaction.
<ul>
<li><code>FALLBACK_ADDRESS</code> is the address to resume execution at if the transaction ends up failing.</li>
<li>Nested <code>tbegin</code> instructions are flattened into a single transaction (since the inner transaction failing would also cause the outer one to fail anyways).</li>
<li>All reads and writes that happen in the transaction are tracked, but not actually executed until the transaction is committed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A <code>tend</code> instruction to atomically commit the current transaction.
<ul>
<li>Basically, this atomically runs all of the writes in the transaction's write set.</li>
<li>For nested transactions, a counter keeps track of the current nesting depth, and ignores all non-top-level commits.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A <code>tabort</code> instruction to abort the current transaction.
<ul>
<li>For nested transactions, this causes all transactions up the stack, all the way to the top-level transaction, to be aborted.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Version management for memory.
<ul>
<li>Register renaming hardware can be used to checkpoint register contents, just like we did for speculative branches.</li>
<li>The first-level data cache (L1 for current Intel processors) can be used for storing the WS and RS.</li>
<li>The last-level data cache (L3 for current Intel processors) can be used to save pre-transaction memory block state.</li>
<li>Cache-coherence traffic can be used to detect conflicts.</li>
<li>Atomic writes for the WS need to be implemented on the memory bus.</li>
<li>For example, suppose we have a 2-level cache where L2 is inclusive of L1. First, we might add a Transaction tag to the L1 cache (set by loads/stores in a transaction). A conflict occurs when a bus upgrade/write-miss occurs on a value in RS or WS, or a read-miss occurs on a value in WS. Upon a conflict occuring, we abort, which clears the Transaction tag from conflicted blocks in RS, invalidates conflicted blocks in WS, and jumps to the fallback address. Upon transaction commit, we copy blocks from the transaction's WS to L2, and clear all Transaction tags matching it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="section-21">23/3/17</h1>
<p>On the IBM's POWER8 architecture, the caches are write-through, and the L2 cache has a special region of content-addressible memory called <strong>transactional memory</strong> with 64 entries, each one storing a block address, memory transaction state (load/store/invalid), and ref bits. The L2 cache is inclusive, while the L3 cache is non-inclusive. IBM publishes reference guides with more details and code examples online.</p>
<p>The <code>tbegin</code> and <code>tend</code> instructions must implicitly have a memory barrier - they always need to wait for all memory operations in progress to finish before they can run.</p>
<p>Transactional Lock Elision (TLE) is a technique where we replace lock acquire/release operations with transaction begin/end operations. If there's not going to be a lot of lock contention (lock acquisition doesn't block that often), this can improve parallelism.</p>
<h2 id="memory-consistency">Memory Consistency</h2>
<p>Memory consistency deals with the ordering of memory references between processors.</p>
<p>Suppose we have two threads, one running <code>A = 5; if (B == 0) f();</code>, and the other running <code>B = 5; if (A == 0) f();</code>. Clearly, within a thread we can freely re-order instructions, because there are no intra-thread data dependencies. However, between threads, if we reorder the instructions in each thread, <code>f</code> can get called twice.</p>
<p><strong>Sequential consistency</strong> is the property that the result of any execution of some parallel code is the same as if the operations on all processors were executed in a sequential order, and the operations run by each processor are in their original order specified in the program within this sequence of operations. Essentially, this means that loads and stores must execute in order.</p>
<p>However, running loads/stores in order can significantly reduce performance. Instead, we might use <strong>relaxed consistency models</strong> - like sequential consistency, but we're allowed to reorder certain sequences of reads/writes (e.g., we might allow writes in different threads to be re-ordered). Note that within a thread, they still appear in order. These are generally used over sequential consistency models in the real world.</p>
<p>Total Store Ordering (TSO) is one of these relaxed consistency models, where a read after a write can actually happen as a write after a read, if the two operations occur on different threads. In this scheme, the order of writes to memory by multiple processors is seen in the same order by all processors. This is used by SPARC and x86.</p>
<p>Weak Ordering (TSO) is another, where all sequences of writes/reads are re-orderable, but two loads are never re-ordered if the result of the first load is used to calculate the address of the second load, and two writes to the same location by the same processor are never re-ordered. This is used by POWER and ARM.</p>
<h2 id="multithreaded-processors">Multithreaded Processors</h2>
<p>Suppose we have a chip capable of doing 6 dispatches/commits per cycle, and two threads to run on the chip. How do we divide thread operations between chip resources?</p>
<ul>
<li>Chip Multiprocessor Multithreading (CMP) would run both threads at the same time, each with 3-way superscalar operations.
<ul>
<li>The OS is responsible for doing the actual thread switching, whereas the other schemes have the hardware do this.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Coarse-grained Multithreading (CGMT) would run thread A for a while, then run thread B, and alternate, each thread with 6-way superscalar operations.
<ul>
<li>Usually switching happens upon a high-latency event, like a cache miss.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fine-grained Multithreading (FGMT) is similar to course-grained multithreading, but switches a lot more often, up to switching after every cycle.
<ul>
<li>An extreme example of this is the Tera MTA computer, which had 128 hardware threads, switched on every cycle. 128 threads meant it didn't even need a cache, since by the time a given thread got around to its next instruction, 128 cycles would have passed, so we could just request data from main memory!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) is sort of a combination of CMP and CGMT - instructions from up to 6 different threads can be dispatched in every cycle, and the instructions can be arbitrarily chosen for the 6 dispatches.
<ul>
<li>Threads are active in all stages at the same time, so we need register renaming hardware to ensure each thread sees the correct data.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In all of these cases, the hardware maintains the context for all running hardware threads (e.g., registers, RATs, etc.).</p>
<p>The IBM POWER8 architecture can operate in 1-way (single-threaded), 2-way, 4-way, or 8-way SMT modes.</p>
<h1 id="section-22">28/3/17</h1>
<h2 id="data-level-parallelism">Data-level Parallelism</h2>
<p>So far we've seen instruction-level parallelism, thread-level parallelism, and data-level parallelism. Now we'll look at data-level parallelism in more detail.</p>
<p>One of the most common data-level parallelism implementations are GPUs - they're designed to do operations on many pieces of data at once. GPUs are good at large-scale parallel data, but they aren't that good at branching. The raw compute power of GPUs make them a several orders of magnitude faster than even the best CPUs, for certain highly parallel tasks.</p>
<p>For real implementations of the POWER8 architecture, about 25% of the die space is integer/float compute units, around 25% is for the load/store unit (including the L1 data cache), and the rest is mostly fetch/scheduling/out-of-order execution hardware.</p>
<p>For a GTX 1080, about 80% of the die space is for functional units and the L1 cache, and the rest is for the L2 cache and scheduling hardware.</p>
<p>GPUs are usually programmed with CUDA or OpenCL. CUDA is proprietary and designed by and supported by Nvidia alone, while OpenCL is an open standard and is supported by all of the major GPU vendors. CUDA came first, and had a significant performance advantage for a while, though OpenCL is catching up.</p>
<p>In the CUDA programming model, the GPU has compute grids, containing blocks, which in turn contain threads:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each thread has access to fast local private memory (L1 data cache and registers), and runs one instance of the program (the program is also known as the kernel).</li>
<li>A block is a set of concurrent threads, each one working on a different piece of data. Blocks use barrier synchronization so that all threads execute in lockstep, and each block has somewhat fast shared memory that all of its threads can use.</li>
<li>A grid is an array of blocks, all running the same kernel, that all have access to some kind of slow global memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Nvidia GPUs, on the die there are hundreds and hundreds of cores, each core containing a float unit, integer, unit, operand collector, and result queue.</p>
<h1 id="section-23">30/3/17</h1>
<p>Many-core architectures combine many simple cores onto a single core. They're easier to program than GPUs, since each core is a lot more CPU-like.</p>
<p>For example, the Intel Phi architecture has a VPU (Vector Processing Unit), with 512 bit operands, 32 vector registers (which can hold floats/ints), and 8 mask registers (which determine whether a particular instruction will execute) per thread. Individual cores could run operations on each of these registers independently, allowing us to do things like masked vector add in parallel:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span class="cf">for</span> (<span class="dt">int</span> i = <span class="dv">0</span>; i &lt;n; i ++) {
    <span class="cf">if</span> (residual[i] &gt; epsilon) {
        x[i] += correction[i];
    }
}</code></pre></div>
<p>In the VPU architecture, this entire loop might be able to execute in parallel.</p>
<p>The Intel Phi 7120p is clocked like a GPU, with current offerings with gets 2416 GFLOPS and 1.2 GHz clock.</p>
<p>The final should be half problem solving based on content, and half questions about concepts from the course. Sample final will be posted today. Questions will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speculative loads (on VLIW and on scalar processors).</li>
<li>Loop unrolling (why is it useful on in-order processors but not as useful in out-of-order pipelines?).</li>
</ul>
<p>Overview of assignment 2 questions 1 and 3.</p>
