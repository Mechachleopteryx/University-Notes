<h2 id="enumeration">Enumeration</h2>
<h3 id="sets-and-combinatorics">Sets and Combinatorics</h3>
<p>Combinatorics is a discrete mathematics. Topics include enumeration (counting) and graph theory.</p>
<p>The <strong>size/cardinality</strong> of a set <span class="math inline">A</span> is denoted <span class="math inline">\abs{A}</span>. It is the number of elements it contains, if it is finite, and some other things if it is infinite.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">[n]</span> is the set of all positive integers from 1 to <span class="math inline">n</span>, inclusive.</p>
<p>The <strong>Cartesian product</strong> of two sets <span class="math inline">A</span> and <span class="math inline">B</span> is <span class="math inline">A \times B = \set{(a, b) \middle| a \in A, b \in B}</span>. In other words, it is the set of all pairs of elements from both sets. This can easily be extended to more than two sets: <span class="math inline">A \times B \times C</span>.</p>
<p>Also, <span class="math inline">A^k = A \times \ldots \times A</span> (<span class="math inline">k</span> times). Also, <span class="math inline">A^0 = \set{()}</span> - the set containing the empty tuple.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">A</span> and <span class="math inline">B</span> are finite, then <span class="math inline">\abs{A \times B} = \abs{A}\abs{B}</span>.</p>
<p>Consider all possible results of throwing two six-sided dice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clearly, the set of all possible results for each die is <span class="math inline">[6]</span> and <span class="math inline">[6]</span>.<br />
So the set of all possible results of both die is <span class="math inline">[6] \times [6] = \set{(a, b) \middle| a, b \in [6]}</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Find the number of possible binary strings of length <span class="math inline">n</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clearly, each digit in the string is of the set <span class="math inline">\set{0, 1}</span>, and there are <span class="math inline">n</span> digits.<br />
Clearly, the number of possiblities are <span class="math inline">\abs{\set{0, 1} \times \ldots \times \set{0, 1}}</span> (<span class="math inline">n</span> times), or <span class="math inline">2^n</span>.<br />
The set of possible binary strings is therefore <span class="math inline">\set{0, 1}^n</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">S = A \cup B</span>. If <span class="math inline">A \cap B = \emptyset</span>, then <span class="math inline">\abs{S} = \abs{A} + \abs{B}</span>. In other words, if two sets share nothing in common, then their disjunction has a size equal to the sum of their sizes.</p>
<p>We could say that the Cartesian product is analogous to multiplcation, and disjunction is analogous to addition.</p>
<h3 id="permutations">Permutations</h3>
<p>A <strong>permutation</strong> is the rearrangement of the elements of <span class="math inline">[n]</span> - an ordered set. For example, all permutations of <span class="math inline">[3]</span> are <span class="math inline">\set{1, 2, 3}, \set{1, 3, 2}, \set{2, 1, 3}, \set{2, 3, 1}, \set{3, 1, 2}, \set{3, 2, 1}</span>.</p>
<p>In general, <span class="math inline">[n]</span> has <span class="math inline">n!</span> permutations. We find these permutations by picking each of the <span class="math inline">n</span> elements for the first position, and for each of these, we pick each of the <span class="math inline">n - 1</span> remaining elements for the second, and for each of these, we pick each of the <span class="math inline">n - 2</span> remaining elements for the third, and so on.</p>
<p>For example, find the permutations of <span class="math inline">\set{1, 2, 3}</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, we choose 1 as the first position, so the remaining elements are <span class="math inline">\set{2, 3}</span>.<br />
Now we choose each of 2 and 3 for the second position, to yield the permutations <span class="math inline">\set{1, 2, 3}</span> and <span class="math inline">\set{1, 3, 2}</span>.<br />
Second, we choose 2 as the first position, so the remaining elements are <span class="math inline">\set{1, 3}</span>.<br />
Now we choose each of 1 and 3 for the second position, to yield the permutations <span class="math inline">\set{2, 1, 3}</span> and <span class="math inline">\set{2, 3, 1}</span>.<br />
Third, we choose 3 as the first position, so the remaining elements are <span class="math inline">\set{1, 2}</span>.<br />
Now we choose each of 1 and 2 for the second position, to yield the permutations <span class="math inline">\set{3, 1, 2}</span> and <span class="math inline">\set{3, 2, 1}</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every permutation is also a bijection, mapping elements from <span class="math inline">[n]</span> into a different set. Formally, <span class="math inline">\sigma: [n] \to [n]</span>. For example, the permutation <span class="math inline">\set{2, 3, 1}</span> maps <span class="math inline">\set{A, B, C}</span> to <span class="math inline">\set{B, C, A}</span>. In other words, it behaves something like a function.</p>
<h3 id="combinations">Combinations</h3>
<p>A <strong>combination</strong> is a possible way of &quot;choosing&quot; <span class="math inline">k</span> elements of a set <span class="math inline">[n]</span>, where <span class="math inline">k \le n</span>. In other words, it is a subset of size <span class="math inline">k</span> of the set <span class="math inline">[n]</span>.</p>
<p>A subset of size <span class="math inline">k</span> is known as a <span class="math inline">k</span>-subset. A permutation of a <span class="math inline">k</span>-subset is a <span class="math inline">k</span>-permutation, and a combination of a <span class="math inline">k</span>-subset is a <span class="math inline">k</span>-combination.</p>
<p>We find these subsets by basically taking the first <span class="math inline">k</span> elements of each permutation. We then get the set containing all the possible <span class="math inline">k</span>-permutations, but each one is duplicated <span class="math inline">(n - k)!</span> times because there are that many that start with those particular <span class="math inline">k</span> elements and are followed by all permutations of the remaining elements.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are <span class="math inline">\frac{n!}{(n - k)!}</span> <span class="math inline">k</span>-permutations of <span class="math inline">[n]</span>. Clearly, each <span class="math inline">k</span>-combination corresponds to <span class="math inline">k!</span> <span class="math inline">k</span>-permutations, because combinations are basically permutations without order.</p>
<p>So the number of <span class="math inline">k</span>-combinations is a factor of <span class="math inline">k!</span> less than the number of <span class="math inline">k</span>-permutations, and is given by <span class="math inline">\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}</span>.</p>
<p>In general, <span class="math inline">[n]</span> has <span class="math inline">\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}</span> combinations of size <span class="math inline">k</span>. This can be represented by <span class="math inline">n \choose k</span>. If <span class="math inline">n &lt; k</span>, we define <span class="math inline">{n \choose k} = 0</span>.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">7/5/14</h1>
<h2 id="bijections">Bijections</h2>
<p>A <strong>bijection</strong> is a function that maps a set <span class="math inline">S</span> to another set <span class="math inline">T</span>, and is one to one and onto.</p>
<p>One to one means that the function has a unique element of <span class="math inline">T</span> for every value of <span class="math inline">S</span> - no two things in <span class="math inline">S</span> are mapped to the same element of <span class="math inline">T</span>. It is possible that <span class="math inline">T</span> is larger than <span class="math inline">S</span>, so <span class="math inline">\abs{T} \ge \abs{S}</span>.</p>
<p>Onto means that the function has a unique element of <span class="math inline">S</span> for every value of <span class="math inline">T</span> - every thing in <span class="math inline">T</span> must also have an element in <span class="math inline">S</span> that maps to it. Because there must be one element in <span class="math inline">S</span> for every element of <span class="math inline">T</span>, so <span class="math inline">\abs{S} \ge \abs{T}</span>.</p>
<p>A bijection is therefore a function that maps a set's elements to the elements of another set of the same size. Every element in either set has a unique corresponding element in the other set.</p>
<p>It is often tedious to prove that it is one to one and onto. We can prove a function is a bijection very easily, by proving that it has an inverse.</p>
<h3 id="bijection-inverse-theorem">Bijection Inverse Theorem</h3>
<p>Proposition: a function is a bijection if and only if it has an inverse.</p>
<p>The <strong>inverse</strong> of <span class="math inline">f: S \to T</span> is a function <span class="math inline">f^{-1}</span> such that <span class="math inline">\forall x \in S, f^{-1}(f(x)) = x</span> and <span class="math inline">\forall y \in T, f(f^{-1}(y)) = y</span>. It is basically a reverse mapping backwards from <span class="math inline">T</span> to <span class="math inline">S</span>.</p>
<p>For example, let <span class="math inline">S</span> be the set of all <span class="math inline">k</span>-subsets of <span class="math inline">[n]</span> and <span class="math inline">T</span> be the set of all <span class="math inline">(n - k)</span>-subsets of <span class="math inline">[n]</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If <span class="math inline">n = 3, k = 1</span>, then <span class="math inline">S = \set{\set{1}, \set{2}, \set{3}}, T = \set{\set{1, 2}, \set{1, 3}, \set{2, 3}}</span>.<br />
One bijection over these sets would be <span class="math inline">f: S \to T</span> where <span class="math inline">f(A) = [n] \setminus A</span>. This is a bijection because it maps every item in <span class="math inline">S</span> to a unique item in <span class="math inline">T</span>, with no items in <span class="math inline">T</span> left over.<br />
Also, since <span class="math inline">\abs{A} = k</span> and <span class="math inline">A \subseteq [n]</span>, <span class="math inline">\abs{f(A)} = \abs{[n]} - \abs{A} = n - k</span>, as required.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">f^{-1}(B) = [n] \setminus B</span>. Since the function has an inverse, <span class="math inline">f</span> is a bijection and <span class="math inline">\abs{S} = \abs{T} = {n \choose k} = {n \choose n - k}</span>.<br />
As an aside, we proved that <span class="math inline">{n \choose k} = {n \choose n - k}</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another example would be a mapping <span class="math inline">f: S \to T</span> where <span class="math inline">S</span> is all the subsets of <span class="math inline">[n]</span> and <span class="math inline">T</span> is all binary strings of length <span class="math inline">n</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An obvious bijection would be to map all the subsets to binary strings such that each digit is 1 if and only if the index of that digit is in the set.<br />
Formally, we would write that as <span class="math inline">f(A) = a_n \cdots a_1, a_i = \begin{cases} 1 &amp;\text{if } i \in A \\ 0 &amp;\text{if } i \notin A \end{cases}, i \in [n]</span>.<br />
We can also prove this is a bijection by finding its inverse: <span class="math inline">f^{-1}(a_n \cdots a_1) = \set{i \in [n] \middle| a_i = 1}</span>.<br />
Since it is a bijection, <span class="math inline">\abs{S} = \abs{T}</span>, so there are the same number of subsets as there are binary strings of length <span class="math inline">n</span>.<br />
Since there are <span class="math inline">2^n</span> possible binary strings, there are also <span class="math inline">2^n</span> subsets of <span class="math inline">[n]</span>.<br />
This also gives us an algorithm for listing all the subsets. Since binary strings are easy to list by counting upwards, we simply apply <span class="math inline">f^{-1}</span> to the list of all the binary strings of length <span class="math inline">n</span> to get the subsets of <span class="math inline">[n]</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="binomial-theorem">Binomial Theorem</h2>
<p>Proposition: <span class="math inline">(1 + x)^n = \sum_{k = 0}^n {n \choose k} x^k</span>.</p>
<p>Clearly, <span class="math inline">(1 + x)^n = (1 + x) \cdots (1 + x)</span>. Clearly, each term in the expansion takes either a <span class="math inline">1</span> or an <span class="math inline">x</span> from each of the factors.</p>
<p>For example, <span class="math inline">(1 + x)^3 = (1 + x)(1 + x)(1 + x) = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot x + 1 \cdot x \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot x \cdot x</span>. Clearly, the factors of each term is in the Cartesian product of the set <span class="math inline">\set{1, x}^n</span>.</p>
<p>We can also represent this using a Cartesian product. Clearly, <span class="math inline">\set{1, x}^n = \set{(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \middle| a_1, \ldots, a_n \in \set{1, x}}</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, <span class="math inline">(1 + x)^n = \sum_{(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \in \set{1, x}^n} a_1 \cdots a_n</span>.</p>
<p>Clearly, each <span class="math inline">a_1 \cdots a_n</span> adds another <span class="math inline">x^k</span> where <span class="math inline">k</span> is the number of occurrences of <span class="math inline">x</span>. Since there are <span class="math inline">n \choose k</span> ways of picking <span class="math inline">k</span> occurrences of <span class="math inline">x</span>, and all possible combinations are in the Cartesian product, there are <span class="math inline">n \choose k</span> terms that are <span class="math inline">x^k</span>.</p>
<p>Since the highest power is <span class="math inline">x^n</span>, <span class="math inline">(1 + x)^n = \sum_{k = 0}^n {n \choose k} x^k</span>.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">9/5/14</h1>
<p>In combinatorial proofs, we often prove that two things are equal by constructing a set such that if we count the number of elements it contains in one way it results in one side, and when we count another way it results in the other side.</p>
<p>So if we wanted to prove <span class="math inline">A = B</span>, then we'd have a set such that finding its size one way results in <span class="math inline">A</span>, and in another way results in <span class="math inline">B</span>.</p>
<h3 id="disjoint-sets">Disjoint Sets</h3>
<p>Two sets <span class="math inline">A</span> and <span class="math inline">B</span> are <strong>disjoint sets</strong> if they have no elements in common - <span class="math inline">A \cap B = \emptyset</span>. Three or more sets are disjoint if all of those sets are all disjoint to each other - they all contain unique elements.</p>
<p>If the sets <span class="math inline">S_1, \ldots, S_n</span> are disjoint, then <span class="math inline">\abs{S_1 \cup \ldots \cup S_n} = \abs{S_1} + \ldots + \abs{S_n}</span>. This is because all the elements are unique, so the union is simply the set containing all the original elements.</p>
<p>If we replace <span class="math inline">x</span> with 1 in the Binomial theorem, we get <span class="math inline">2^n = \sum_{k = 0}^n {n \choose k}</span>. The <span class="math inline">n \choose k</span> values are known as the <strong>binomial coefficients</strong>.</p>
<p>We want a combinatoric proof of this rather than a simple algebraic proof. What we will do is create a set, and when we count it one way, we get <span class="math inline">2^n</span>, and when we prove it another way, we get <span class="math inline">\sum_{k = 0}^n {n \choose k}</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">S</span> be the set of all subsets of <span class="math inline">[n]</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\abs{S} = 2^n</span>, from the proof of bijections of binary strings.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">S_k</span> be the set of all <span class="math inline">k</span>-subsets of <span class="math inline">[n]</span>, for <span class="math inline">0 \le k \le n</span>. Then <span class="math inline">S = S_0 \cup \ldots \cup S_n</span>, and <span class="math inline">S_0, \ldots, S_n</span> are disjoint sets.</p>
<p>Then <span class="math inline">\abs{S} = \abs{S_1} + \ldots + \abs{S_n}</span>, and <span class="math inline">\abs{S_k} = {n \choose k}</span> (since a <span class="math inline">k</span>-subset is all the ways we can choose <span class="math inline">k</span> elements out of <span class="math inline">n</span>).</p>
<p>So <span class="math inline">\abs{S} = 2^n = \sum_{k = 0}^n {n \choose k}</span>.</p>
<h3 id="pascals-triangle">Pascal's Triangle</h3>
<p>Using this, we can draw <strong>Pascal's Triangle</strong>, a triangle listing all the binomial coefficients:</p>
<pre><code>               1
            1    1
         1    2    1
      1    3    3    1
   1    4    6    4    1
1    5   10   10    5    1
...</code></pre>
<p>The <span class="math inline">n</span>th row of Pascal's Triangle is all the values of <span class="math inline">n \choose k</span>, and each column of each row is for <span class="math inline">k</span> from 1 to <span class="math inline">n</span> inclusive.</p>
<p>From the triangle we notice that <span class="math inline">{n \choose k} = {n - 1 \choose k} + {n - 1 \choose k - 1}</span>. However, we want to prove this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">S</span> be the set of all <span class="math inline">k</span>-subsets of <span class="math inline">[n]</span>.<br />
Then <span class="math inline">\abs{S} = {n \choose k}</span>. Let <span class="math inline">S_1</span> be the set of all <span class="math inline">k</span>-subsets of <span class="math inline">[n]</span> that include <span class="math inline">n</span>, and <span class="math inline">S_2</span> be the set of all subsets that do not.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">S = S_1 \cup S_2</span>, which is a disjoint set, so <span class="math inline">\abs{S} = \abs{S_1} + \abs{S_2}</span>.<br />
Clearly, every set in <span class="math inline">S_1</span> contains <span class="math inline">n</span>, plus <span class="math inline">k - 1</span> elements from <span class="math inline">[n - 1]</span>, since we can't use <span class="math inline">n</span> again.<br />
So <span class="math inline">\abs{S_1} = {n - 1 \choose k - 1}</span>, since it is the set of all <span class="math inline">(k - 1)</span>-subsets of <span class="math inline">[n - 1]</span>.<br />
Clearly, every set in <span class="math inline">S_1</span> contains <span class="math inline">k</span> elements, and we can only choose from <span class="math inline">[n - 1]</span> elements.<br />
So <span class="math inline">\abs{S_2} = {n - 1 \choose k}</span>, since it is the set of all <span class="math inline">k</span>-subsets of <span class="math inline">[n - 1]</span>.<br />
So <span class="math inline">{n \choose k} = {n - 1 \choose k} + {n - 1 \choose k - 1}</span>.</p>

<h3 id="hockey-stick-identity">Hockey Stick Identity</h3>
<p>We can also prove it algebraically:</p>

<p>If <span class="math inline">f(x)</span> is a power series, then let <span class="math inline">[x^n]f(x)</span> represent the coefficient of <span class="math inline">x^n</span> in <span class="math inline">f(x)</span>.<br />
So <span class="math inline">[x^k](1 + x)^n = {n \choose k}</span>.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">[x^k](1 + x)^n = [x^k](1 + x)(1 + x)^{n - 1} = [x^k](1 + x)^{n - 1} + [x^k]x(1 + x)^{n - 1}</span>.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">[x^k](1 + x)^{n - 1} = {n - 1 \choose k}</span>.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">[x^k]x(1 + x)^{n - 1} = [x^{k - 1}](1 + x)^{n - 1} = {n - 1 \choose k - 1}</span>, since the <span class="math inline">x</span> factor increases all the powers of <span class="math inline">x</span> in the power series by 1.<br />
So <span class="math inline">[x^k](1 + x)^n = [x^k](1 + x)^{n - 1} + [x^k]x(1 + x)^{n - 1} = {n \choose k} = {n - 1 \choose k} + {n - 1 \choose k - 1}</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the above identity we know that <span class="math inline">{n + k \choose n} = {n + k - 1 \choose n} + {n + k - 1 \choose n - 1}</span>, since we substituted <span class="math inline">n + k</span> for <span class="math inline">n</span> and <span class="math inline">n</span> for <span class="math inline">k</span>.</p>
<p>If we expand the first term of the right side using the same identity, we get <span class="math inline">{n + k \choose n} = {n + k - 2 \choose n} + {n + k - 2 \choose n - 1} + {n + k - 1 \choose n - 1}</span>.</p>
<p>If we keep expanding the first term on the right side, we find that we get <span class="math inline">{n + k - (k + 1) \choose n} + {n + k - (k + 1) \choose n - 1} + \ldots + {n + k - 1 \choose n - 1}</span>. Clearly, <span class="math inline">n + k - (k + 1) \choose n = 0</span>.</p>
<p>So by induction, we get <span class="math inline">\sum_{i = 0}^k {n + i - 1 \choose n - 1} = {n + k \choose n}</span>.</p>
<p>Now we want to prove this combinatorially:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">S</span> be the set of all <span class="math inline">n</span>-subsets of <span class="math inline">[n + k]</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\abs{S} = {n + k \choose n}</span>.<br />
Let <span class="math inline">S_i</span> be the set of all <span class="math inline">n</span>-subsets of <span class="math inline">[n + k]</span> whose largest element is <span class="math inline">n + i</span>, where <span class="math inline">0 \le i \le k</span>.<br />
Clearly, the largest element of each <span class="math inline">n</span>-subset is between <span class="math inline">n</span> and <span class="math inline">n + k</span> inclusive.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">S = S_0 \cup \ldots \cup S_k</span>, and this is a disjoint set, so <span class="math inline">\abs{S} = \abs{S_0} + \ldots + \abs{S_k}</span>.<br />
Clearly, each set in <span class="math inline">S_i</span> must contain <span class="math inline">n + i</span> as the largest element, and all the other elements must be in <span class="math inline">[n + i - 1]</span> (since they must be less than the largest element).<br />
So there are <span class="math inline">n + i - 1</span> elements to choose from, out of <span class="math inline">n - 1</span> spots (one spot of <span class="math inline">n</span> was taken by the largest element). So there are <span class="math inline">n + i - 1 \choose n - 1</span> elements in <span class="math inline">S_i</span>.<br />
So <span class="math inline">{n + k \choose n} = \abs{S} = {n - 1 \choose n - 1} + \ldots + {n + k - 1 \choose n - 1} = \sum_{i = 0}^k {n + i - 1 \choose n - 1}</span></p>

<p>This is known as the <strong>hockey stick identity</strong>. The reason for this is because it states that in Pascal's Triangle, the value of a number in the triangle is the sum of all the numbers in either diagonal passing through the number directly above it from the outside edge of the triangle until it is diagonal to the number we want.</p>
<p>For example, the topmost and leftmost 10 in Pascal's Triangle is <span class="math inline">10 = 1 + 3 + 6</span>, or <span class="math inline">10 = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1</span>.</p>

<p>Proof techniques: bijections, partitioning sets into two sets, and counting two sets in different ways.</p>
<h2 id="generating-series">Generating Series</h2>
<p>We can also prove by using power series.</p>
<p>Given a set <span class="math inline">S</span>, the universe of discourse, where each element <span class="math inline">\sigma \in S</span> is associated with a non-negative integer weight <span class="math inline">w(\sigma)</span>, the <strong>generating series/generating function</strong> of <span class="math inline">S</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">w(\sigma)</span> is <span class="math inline">\Phi_S(x) = \sum_{\sigma \in S} x^{w(\sigma)}</span>. If we expand and collect like terms, the coefficient of each <span class="math inline">x^k</span> is the number of elements in <span class="math inline">S</span> with exactly the weight <span class="math inline">k</span>.</p>
<p>For example, let <span class="math inline">S</span> be the set of all subsets of <span class="math inline">[3]</span>, and let <span class="math inline">w(A) = \abs{A}</span>. So <span class="math inline">S = \set{\emptyset, \set{1}, \set{2}, \set{3}, \set{1, 2}, \set{1, 3}, \set{2, 3}, \set{1, 2, 3}}</span>. The corresponding weights are <span class="math inline">0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3</span>.</p>
<p>Then the generating series is <span class="math inline">1 + x + x + x + x^2 + x^2 + x^2 + x^3 = 1 + 3x + 3x^2 + x^3 = (1 + x)^3</span>, from the binomial theorem.</p>
<p>What does each coefficient of <span class="math inline">x^k</span> mean? It is the number of elements that have exactly the weight <span class="math inline">k</span>. In our particular example, it is the number of elements of size <span class="math inline">k</span>.</p>
<p>So if <span class="math inline">a_k</span> is the weight of the <span class="math inline">k</span>th subset, then <span class="math inline">\Phi_S(x) = \sum_{k \ge 0} a_k x^k</span>.</p>
<p>Now we want to generalize this. Let <span class="math inline">S</span> be the set of all subsets of <span class="math inline">[n]</span> and <span class="math inline">w(A) = \abs{A}</span>. Then the coefficient of <span class="math inline">x^k</span> in <span class="math inline">\Phi_S(x)</span> is <span class="math inline">n \choose k</span>, because it is the number of <span class="math inline">k</span>-subsets of <span class="math inline">[n]</span> (the number of ways we can choose <span class="math inline">k</span> elements from <span class="math inline">n</span> elements).</p>
<p>So <span class="math inline">\Phi_S(x) = \sum_{k = 0}^n {n \choose k} x^k = (1 + x)^n</span>, by the binomial theorem.</p>
<p>How many ways can we throw two dice and get a sum of 10?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clearly, <span class="math inline">S = [6] \times [6]</span>, the Cartesian product.<br />
We define <span class="math inline">(a, b)</span> to be a pair of dice throws, and the weighting function to be their sum, <span class="math inline">w((a, b)) = a + b</span>.<br />
So <span class="math inline">\Phi_{[6] \times [6]}(x) = \sum_{(a, b) \in [6] \times [6]} x^{a + b}</span>.<br />
If we do this by hand, by considering every possible pair, we find that the generating series is <span class="math inline">x^2 + 2x^3 + 3x^4 + 4x^5 + 5x^6 + 6x^7 + 5x^8 + 4x^9 + 3x^{10} + 2x^{11} + x^{12}</span>.<br />
So the answer is the coefficient of <span class="math inline">x^{10}</span>, which is 3.<br />
If we factor this, we get <span class="math inline">(x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6)^2</span>. Note that when we multiply this out, we add up the exponents, just like the weight function.<br />
However, we want to solve it more simply. Suppose we have two infinite sided dice.<br />
Then <span class="math inline">S = \mb{N} \times \mb{N}</span>, the set of all pairs of natural numbers. We keep the same weight function, <span class="math inline">w((a, b)) = a + b</span>.<br />
So <span class="math inline">\Phi_S(x) = x^2 + 2x^3 + 3x^4 + \ldots = (x + x^2 + \ldots)^2</span>.<br />
Incidentally, <span class="math inline">(x + x^2 + \ldots)^2 = \frac{x^2}{(1 - x)^2}</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general, for a counting problem:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Define the set of objects.</li>
<li>Define a weight function related to the problem such that we get the answer we need.</li>
<li>Find the generating series.</li>
<li>Possibly find the coefficient of <span class="math inline">x^k</span></li>
</ol>
<p>We rarely substitute a value for <span class="math inline">x</span>. It acts as a way to keep the coefficients of <span class="math inline">x</span> as separate values. As a result we don't really need to worry about convergence or divergence.</p>
<p>This technique is useful because the generating series is sometimes easier to find than the actual coefficients, yet it can be used to find the coefficients.</p>
<p>The reason generating series are useful is because <span class="math inline">[x^n]\Phi_S(x)</span> is the number of times <span class="math inline">w(\sigma) = n</span>. This allows us to find the number of <span class="math inline">\sigma</span> in <span class="math inline">S</span> that have <span class="math inline">w(\sigma) = n</span>.</p>
<p>We can solve for <span class="math inline">[x^k]</span> explicitly by writing <span class="math inline">\Phi_S(x)</span> as a power series, solving for the index <span class="math inline">i</span> that would result in the term having <span class="math inline">x^k</span>, and obtaining the coefficient of that index. However, leaving it in the form of <span class="math inline">[x^n]f(x)</span> is often sufficient for an answer.</p>
<p>For example, given <span class="math inline">[x^k]\sum_{i = 1}^n 2i^ix^{2i}</span>, we solve <span class="math inline">x^k = x^{2i}</span> and <span class="math inline">i = \frac k 2</span>. Then <span class="math inline">[x^k]\sum_{i = 1}^n 2i^ix^{2i} = 2i^i = 2\left(\frac k 2\right)^{\frac k 2}</span>.</p>

<h2 id="formal-power-series">Formal Power Series</h2>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">a_1, a_2, \ldots</span> be a sequence of numbers. Then the <strong>formal power series</strong> associated with <span class="math inline">\{a_n\}</span> is <span class="math inline">A(x) = \sum_{k \ge 0} a_k x^k</span>.</p>
<p>This allows us to represent the entire sequence using one power series.</p>
<p>The coefficient of <span class="math inline">x^n</span> in <span class="math inline">A(x)</span> is denoted <span class="math inline">[x^n]A(x)</span>. For example, <span class="math inline">[x^2](1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3 + \ldots) = 3</span>.</p>
<p>Two power series are <strong>equal</strong> if they have the same coefficients for the same powers: <span class="math inline">A(x) = B(x) \iff \forall n \ge 0, [x^n]A(x) = [x^n]B(x)</span>.</p>
<p>Addition is defined as <span class="math inline">A(x) + B(x) = \sum_{k \ge 0} \left([x^k]A(x) + [x^k]B(x)\right)x^k</span>.</p>
<p>For example, if <span class="math inline">A(x) = (1 + 2x)^{10}, B = 1 + x + x^2 + \ldots</span>, find <span class="math inline">[x^n](A(x) + B(x))</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clearly, <span class="math inline">A(x) = (1 + 2x)^{10} = \sum_{k = 0}^{10} {10 \choose k} (2x)^k = \sum_{k = 0}^{10} {10 \choose k} 2^k x^k</span>.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">B(x) = \sum_{k = 0}^n x^k</span>.<br />
So <span class="math inline">[x^n](A(x) + B(x)) = \begin{cases} 2^n {10 \choose n} + 1 &amp;\text{if } 0 \le n \le 10 \\ 1 &amp;\text{if } n &gt; 10 \end{cases}</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Multiplication is defined as <span class="math inline">A(x)B(x) = \sum_{n \ge 0} \left(\sum_{i = 0}^n a_i b_{n - i}\right)x^n</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\sum_{i = 0}^n a_i b_{i - 1}</span> is always finite, multiplication of power series is closed under multiplication.</p>
<p>This can be derived by multiplying out <span class="math inline">(a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \ldots)(b_0 + b_1x + b_2x^2 + \ldots) = (a_0 b_0 + a_0 b_1 a_0 b_2 + \ldots) + (a_1 b_0 + a_1 b_1 a_1 b_2 + \ldots) + (a_2 b_0 + a_2 b_1 a_2 b_2 + \ldots) + \ldots</span>. Clearly, the coefficient of <span class="math inline">x^n</span> is <span class="math inline">a_0 b_n + a_1 b_{n - 1} + \ldots + a_n b_0</span>, because these are all the ways the values can add up to <span class="math inline">n</span> - <span class="math inline">a_i</span> is the coefficient of <span class="math inline">x^i</span> and <span class="math inline">b_j</span> is the coefficient of <span class="math inline">x^j</span>, so it must be that <span class="math inline">i + j = n</span>, and <span class="math inline">j = n - i</span>.</p>
<h2 id="inverses">Inverses</h2>
<p>The <strong>inverse</strong> of a power series <span class="math inline">A(x)</span> is <span class="math inline">B(x)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">A(x)B(x) = 1</span>. It is defined as <span class="math inline">A^{-1}(x)</span></p>
<p>What is the inverse of <span class="math inline">1 - x</span>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">B(x) = b_0 + b_1x + b_2x^2 + \ldots</span>. Assume <span class="math inline">A(x)B(x) = 1</span>.<br />
Then <span class="math inline">b_0 + b_1x + b_2x^2 + \ldots - b_0x - b_1x^2 - b_2x^3 - \ldots = 1 = b_0 + (b_1 - b_0)x + (b_2 - b_1)x^2 + (b_3 - b_2)x^3 + \ldots</span>.<br />
So <span class="math inline">b_0 = 1, b_1 - b_0 = 0, b_2 - b_1 = 0, b_3 - b_2 = 0, \ldots</span>, and <span class="math inline">\forall n \ge 0, b_n = 1</span>.<br />
So <span class="math inline">(1 - x)^{-1} = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \ldots = \frac 1 {1 - x}</span>, the geometric series.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="section-5">16/5/14</h1>
<p>The three series to remember are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\frac 1 {1 - x} = 1 + x + x^2 + \ldots</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\frac{1 - x^{k + 1}}{1 - x} = 1 + x + x^2 + \ldots + x^k</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\frac 1 {(1 - x)^k} = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty {n + k - 1 \choose k - 1}x^n</span></li>

<p>What is the inverse of <span class="math inline">x</span>, if it exists?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose <span class="math inline">B(x) = b_0 + b_1x + \ldots</span> exists such that <span class="math inline">xB(x) = 1</span>.<br />
Then <span class="math inline">x(b_0 + b_1x + \ldots) = b_0x + b_1x^2 + \ldots = 1</span>.<br />
This is a contradiction because the left side has no constant term, while the right side does.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we generalize this, any power series that does not have a constant term (any power series that has <span class="math inline">x</span> as a factor) cannot be inverted.</p>
<p>Any power series <span class="math inline">A(x)</span> has an inverse if and only if <span class="math inline">[x^0]A(x) \ne 0</span>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, we can use the identity <span class="math inline">\frac 1 {1 - f(x)} = 1 + f(x) + f(x)^2 + \ldots</span> if <span class="math inline">f(x)</span> is a power series with no constant term. If there is a constant term, then the expansion of <span class="math inline">f(x)^k</span> has a constant term, so the constant term goes to infinity and the series no longer converges.</p>
<h2 id="compositions">Compositions</h2>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">G(x) = \frac 1 {1 - x} = 1 + x + x^2 + \ldots</span>. Then <span class="math inline">G(3x^2) = \frac 1 {1 - 3x^2} = 1 + 3x^2 + 9x^4 + 27x^6</span> and <span class="math inline">[x^n]G(x) = \begin{cases} 3^{\frac n 2} &amp;\text{if } n \text{ is even} \\ 0 &amp;\text{if } n \text{ is odd} \end{cases}</span>.</p>
<p>Now let <span class="math inline">A(x) = G(3x^2)^9 = \frac 1 {(1 - 3x^2)^9}</span>. Then <span class="math inline">A(x) = \sum_{n \ge 0} {n + 9 - 1 \choose 9 - 1} (3x^2)^n = \sum_{n \ge 0} {n + 8 \choose 8}3^nx^{2n}</span>.</p>
<p>So <span class="math inline">[x^{200}]A(x) = {108 \choose 8}3^{100}</span>.</p>
<h3 id="expanding-rational-functions">Expanding Rational Functions</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">B(x) = \sum_{i \ge 0} (x + 2x^2)^i = \frac 1 {1 - (x + 2x^2)} = \frac 1 {1 - x - 2x^2}</span>.</p>
<p>How do we find the coefficients of this series? Let <span class="math inline">B(x) = \sum_{i \ge 0} b_i x^i</span>.</p>
<p>Then <span class="math inline">\frac 1 {1 - x - 2x^2} = \sum_{i \ge 0} (x + 2x^2)^i</span> and <span class="math inline">1 = (1 - x - 2x^2)\sum_{i \ge 0} (x + 2x^2)^i = \sum_{i \ge 0} (x + 2x^2)^i - x\sum_{i \ge 0} (x + 2x^2)^i - 2x^2\sum_{i \ge 0} (x + 2x^2)^i = b_0 + (b_1 - b_0)x + (b_2 - b_1 - 2b_0)x^2 + \ldots + (b_n - b_{n - 1} - 2b_{n - 2})</span>.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">1 = b_0 + (b_1 - b_0)x + (b_2 - b_1 - 2b_0)x^2 + \ldots + (b_n - b_{n - 1} - 2b_{n - 2})</span>, <span class="math inline">b_0 = 1</span> and <span class="math inline">b_1 - b_0 = 0</span>, and <span class="math inline">b_n - b_{n - 1} - 2b_{n - 2}</span>.</p>
<p>So the coefficients of the power series can be defined in terms of a recurrence relation: <span class="math inline">b_0 = 1, b_1 = 1, b_n = b_{n - 1} + 2b_{n - 2}</span>.</p>
<p>We can generalize this to any rational function. Find the coefficients of the power series expansion for <span class="math inline">F(x) = \frac{1 + 2x^4}{1 - 3x - x^3}</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">F(x) = \frac{1 + 2x^4}{1 - 3x - x^3} = \sum_{i \ge 0} f_i x^i</span>. Then <span class="math inline">1 + 2x^4 = \sum_{i \ge 0} f_i x^i - 3x\sum_{i \ge 0} f_i x^i - x^3\sum_{i \ge 0} f_i x^i</span>.<br />
Then <span class="math inline">1 + 2x^4 = f_0 + (f_1 - 3f_0)x + (f_2 - 3f_1)x^2 + (f_3 - 3f_2 - f_0)x^3 + (f_4 - 3f_3 - f_1) + \ldots + (f_n - 3f_{n - 1} - f_{n - 3})x^n</span>. So the coefficients of the left and right sides match and <span class="math inline">f_0 = 1, f_1 - 3f_0 = 0, f_2 - 3f_1 = 0, f_3 - 3f_2 - f_0 = 0, f_4 - 3f_3 - f_1 = 2</span>, and <span class="math inline">f_n - 3f_{n - 1} - f_{n - 3} = 0, n &gt; 4</span>.<br />
Solving, we get <span class="math inline">f_0 = 1, f_1 = 3, f_2 = 9, f_3 = 28, f_4 = 87, f_n = 3f_{n - 1} + f_{n - 3}</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider <span class="math inline">D(x) = \sum_{i \ge 0} (1 + x^2)^i = \frac 1 {1 - (1 + x^2)} = \frac 1 {-x^2}</span>. However, this is <strong>not a power series</strong> - it does not have a constant term!</p>
<p>To see why, we can expand it out: <span class="math inline">D(x) = 1 + (1 + x^2) + (1 + x^2)^2 + \ldots</span>. Note that every term has a 1 term in it when expanded. Therefore, the constant term goes toward infinity.</p>
<p>All power series must be invertible. Therefore, all power series <strong>must have a constant term</strong>. If the constant term is 0 or infinite, then it cannot be inverted and therefore is not a power series.</p>
<p>So when we are composing a series into the geometric series, like <span class="math inline">\sum_{n \ge 0} f(x)</span>, then <span class="math inline">f(x)</span> must not have a constant term, or the above will happen and we will get an infinite constant term.</p>
<p>So the series we put into the geometric series cannot be invertible, and therefore cannot be a power series.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">A \cap B = \emptyset</span>. Let <span class="math inline">w</span> be a weight function on <span class="math inline">A \cup B</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\Phi_{A \cup B}(x) = \Phi_A(x) + \Phi_B(x)</span>.</p>
<p>In other words, the generating series for the disjunction of disjoint sets is the sum of the generating series for each set.</p>
<p>This is because <span class="math inline">\Phi_S = \sum_{\sigma \in S} x^{w(\sigma)} = \sum_{\sigma \in A} x^{w(\sigma)} + \sum_{\sigma \in B} x^{w(\sigma)} = \Phi_A(x) + \Phi_B(x)</span>.</p>

<p>Clearly, <span class="math inline">\frac 1 {1 - x} = \frac 1 {1 - x^2} + \frac x {1 - x^2}</span>.</p>
<p>For example, let <span class="math inline">S_n</span> be the set of all subsets of <span class="math inline">[n]</span> and <span class="math inline">w(A) = \abs{A}</span>.

<p>So <span class="math inline">\Phi_B(x) = \Phi_{S_{n - 1}}(x)</span>, and there is a bijection <span class="math inline">f: A \to S_{n - 1}</span> defined by <span class="math inline">f(T) = T \setminus \set{n}</span>.

<p>There are <span class="math inline">n + k - 1 \choose k - 1</span> ways to add <span class="math inline">k</span> non-negative integers to add up to <span class="math inline">n</span>.</p>
<p>This is because there are <span class="math inline">k</span> buckets and <span class="math inline">n</span> things to fill them with. We want to figure out all the ways we can distribute the <span class="math inline">n</span> things into the <span class="math inline">k</span> buckets.</p>
<p>Each bucket can hold from 0 to <span class="math inline">n</span> things. However, we notice that the order of the things does not matter, only the quantity.</p>
<p>If we line up the things, the buckets actually divide the line into <span class="math inline">k</span> segments, so it basically inserts <span class="math inline">k - 1</span> dividers into the line of <span class="math inline">n</span> things.</p>
<p>Now we consider the dividers as objects, so there are <span class="math inline">n + k - 1</span> of them in total. Therefore there are <span class="math inline">n + k - 1 \choose k - 1</span> ways of putting the things into buckets.</p>
<p>If we wanted to make this a proper proof, we might define a bijection between the tuples and a binary string where there is a run of <span class="math inline">a_1</span> zeroes, a 1, followed by <span class="math inline">a_2</span> zeros, a 1, all the way to <span class="math inline">a_{k - 1}</span> zeros, a 1, and <span class="math inline">a_k</span> zeros.</p>

<p>Assume <span class="math inline">a \ge 5, b \le 3, 2 \mid c</span>.

Clearly, <span class="math inline">\Phi_A(x) = x^5 + x^6 + \ldots = \frac{x^5}{1 - x}, \Phi_B(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3, \Phi_C(x) = 1 + x^2 + x^4 + \ldots = \frac 1 {1 - x^2}</span>, where <span class="math inline">w(\sigma) = \sigma</span> for all three.<br />

<blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">A = \set{5, 6, 7, \ldots}, B = \set{3, 6, 9, \ldots}</span> (we don't include 0 since the values must be at least 1).<br />

<p>Let <span class="math inline">A = \set{1, 3, 5, \ldots}, S = A^0 \cup A^1 \cup \ldots</span>.<br />

Solving as above, there are <span class="math inline">[x^n]\frac{1 - x^2}{1 - x - x^2}</span> compositions of <span class="math inline">n</span> with odd parts.<br />
Let <span class="math inline">S_n</span> be the set of the compositions of <span class="math inline">n</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\abs{S_n} = [x^n]\frac{1 - x^2}{1 - x - x^2}</span>.<br />

We can therefore define a bijection <span class="math inline">f: S_n \to S_{n - 1} \cup S_{n - 2}</span>. One possible bijection is to remove the last element if it is 1, and if it is greater than 1 subtract 2.

We can write this as <span class="math inline">f(a_1, \ldots, a_k) = \begin{cases} (a_1, \ldots, a_{k - 1}) &amp;a_k = 1 \\ (a_1, \ldots, a_{k - 1}, a_k - 2) &amp;a_k &gt; 1 \end{cases}</span>.<br />
We can also define the inverse <span class="math inline">f^{-1}: S_{n - 1} \cup S_{n - 2} \to S_n</span>. In the above case, this would be <span class="math inline">f^{-1}(b_1, \ldots, b_k) = \begin{cases} (b_1, \ldots, b_k + 2) &amp;b_1 + \ldots + b_k = n - 2 \\ (b_1, \ldots, b_k, 1) &amp;b_1 + \ldots + b_k = n - 1 \end{cases}</span>.<br />
So <span class="math inline">S_n = \set{f^{-1}(a_1, \ldots, a_k) \middle| x \in S_{n - 1}} \cup \set{f^{-1}(a_1, \ldots, a_k) \middle| x \in S_{n - 2}}</span>.<br />
So using this, <span class="math inline">S_6</span> can be found by finding <span class="math inline">S_5</span> and <span class="math inline">S_4</span> and applying <span class="math inline">f</span> to every element in their union.

<h2 id="binary-strings">Binary Strings</h2>
<p>A <strong>binary string</strong> is a sequence of 0 and 1. The length is the total number of these digits.</p>
<p>There is one string with length 0 denoted <span class="math inline">\epsilon</span>. It is called the <strong>empty string</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>concatenation</strong> of binary strings <span class="math inline">a</span> and <span class="math inline">b</span> is <span class="math inline">ab</span> - we put all the digits of <span class="math inline">b</span> after <span class="math inline">a</span> to form a new binary string.</p>
<p>A <strong>substring</strong> of <span class="math inline">a</span> is a string <span class="math inline">c</span> such that there exist strings <span class="math inline">b, d</span> such that <span class="math inline">a = bcd</span>.</p>
<p>A <strong>block</strong> is a substring of all 1 that has no 1 on either sides, or all 0 with no 0 on either side. It is the largest possible run of a digit.</p>
<p>We often want to know how many binary strings of length <span class="math inline">n</span> have certain properties.</p>
<p>We first construct a set <span class="math inline">S</span> of all strings with the given properties. Then, we define <span class="math inline">w(s)</span> as the length of the string <span class="math inline">s</span>.

<p>Let <span class="math inline">A, B</span> be sets of strings.</p>

<p>Then <span class="math inline">A^n = AAA \ldots AAA</span>, <span class="math inline">n</span> times. So <span class="math inline">A^0 = \set{\epsilon}, A^1 = A, A^2 = AA, \ldots</span>. So <span class="math inline">00101 \in \set{0, 1}^5</span>.</p>
<p>Then <span class="math inline">A^* = A^0 \cup A^1 \cup A^2 \cup \ldots</span>. This is the binary strings that can be made by concatinating combinations of <span class="math inline">A</span>.

<p>For example, <span class="math inline">\set{0}\set{00}^*</span> is the set of all binary strings of all 0 of odd length. This is because it can be expanded to <span class="math inline">\set{0, 000, 00000, \ldots}</span>.</p>
<p>Another example is <span class="math inline">\set{0}^*(\set{1}\set{0}^*)^*</span>.

<h3 id="generating-series-1">Generating Series</h3>
<p>We want to find the number of binary strings of a given length <span class="math inline">n</span> that satisfy a given property. To do this we can use a generating series over the set of strings that satisfy this property where the weight is the length of the string.</p>
<p>For example, <span class="math inline">\Phi_{\set{0, 1}}(x) = x + x = 2x</span>.</p>
<p>For example, in this case <span class="math inline">\set{0, 1}^n</span> is similar to a Cartensian product <span class="math inline">n</span> times. So in this case, we can use the product lemma: <span class="math inline">\Phi_{\set{0, 1}^n}(x) = 2^nx^n</span></p>
<p>For example, <span class="math inline">\Phi_{\set{0, 1}^*}(x) = \sum_{n \ge 0} \Phi_{\set{0, 1}^n}(x) = \sum_{n \ge 0} 2^nx^n = \frac 1 {1 - 2x}</span>.</p>
<p>What is the generating series for <span class="math inline">\set{0}\set{00}^*\set{1, 11, 111}</span>?</p>

<p>Given sets of binary strings <span class="math inline">A</span> and <span class="math inline">B</span>, <span class="math inline">AB</span> is <strong>ambiguous</strong> if and only if there exist <span class="math inline">(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2) \in A \times B, a_1 \ne a_2 \vee b_1 \ne b_2 \implies a_1b_1 = a_2b_2</span>. Otherwise, <span class="math inline">AB</span> is <strong>unambiguous</strong>.</p>
<p>Basically, if there is more than one way for any binary string to be created by concatenating binary strings in sets, then the set is ambiguous.</p>
<p>Also, <span class="math inline">A \cap B</span> is ambiguous if and only if <span class="math inline">A \cap B \ne \emptyset</span>. This concept can be extended to any number of sets as well.</p>
<h3 id="sumproduct-rule-for-strings">Sum/Product Rule for Strings</h3>
<p>If <span class="math inline">A \cap B</span> is unambiguous, then <span class="math inline">\Phi_{A \cup B}(x) = \Phi_A(x) + \Phi_B(x)</span> where <span class="math inline">w(\sigma) = \sigma</span>.</p>
<p>This can be proved from the sum lemma.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">AB</span> is unambiguous, then <span class="math inline">\Phi_{AB}(x) = \Phi_A(x) \Phi_B(x)</span> where <span class="math inline">w(a, b) = w_a(a) + w_b(b)</span> where <span class="math inline">w_a</span> is the weight function for <span class="math inline">\Phi_A(x)</span> and <span class="math inline">w_b</span> is the weight function for <span class="math inline">\Phi_B(x)</span>.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">AB</span> is unambiguous, there is a bijection between <span class="math inline">AB</span> and <span class="math inline">A \times B</span>, so it follows by the product lemma.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">A^*</span> is unambiguous, then <span class="math inline">\Phi_{A^*}(x) = \frac 1 {1 - \Phi_A(x)}</span> because <span class="math inline">S^* = S^0 \cup S^1 \cup S^2 \cup \ldots</span>.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">A^*</span> is unambiguous, <span class="math inline">A^n</span> is unambiguous.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">\epsilon \notin A</span>, because if it was then <span class="math inline">AA</span> would be ambiguous.<br />
So <span class="math inline">\Phi_A(x)</span> has no constant term and <span class="math inline">\Phi_{A^*}(x)</span> is a geometric series.<br />
So <span class="math inline">\Phi_{A^*}(x) = \frac 1 {1 - \Phi_A(x)}</span>.</p>

<p>There are three basic unambiguous decompositions of the set of all binary strings. A decomposition is a way of writing a set using other sets. Often, the set being decomposed is infinite or otherwise hard to represent.</p>
<p>One is <span class="math inline">\set{0, 1}^*</span>. Every binary string has a unique sequence of the elements in the set that, when concatenated, results in that string (we break the string between each character).</p>
<p>Another is <span class="math inline">\set{0}^*(\set{1}\set{0}^*)^*</span>. Again, there is only one way for each string to be represented using the elements in the set (we break the string just before each 1).</p>
<p>The last is the <strong>block decomposition</strong>: <span class="math inline">\set{0}^*\left(\set{1}\set{1}^*\set{0}\set{0}^*\right)^*\set{1}^*</span>. The reason for the name is because it matches blocks of 1 followed by blocks of 0 an arbitrary number of times.</p>
<p>We can also swap the 1 and 0 to the same effect: <span class="math inline">\set{0}^*(\set{1}\set{0}^*)^*</span> matches the same strings as <span class="math inline">\set{1}^*(\set{0}\set{1}^*)^*</span>.</p>
<p>Also, <span class="math inline">\Phi_A(x) = \abs{A}x</span> if <span class="math inline">A = \set{\ldots}</span>.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">S</span> be the set of all binary strings with no 3 consecutive 0 - strings that do not contain 000. What is the generating series of this set?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can use the <span class="math inline">\set{0}^*(\set{1}\set{0}^*)^*</span> decomposition to match these strings.<br />
Clearly, we can have three consecutive 0 when and only when we have a <span class="math inline">\set{0^*}</span>. Instead, we can replace this with <span class="math inline">\set{\epsilon, 0, 00}</span>, the subset of <span class="math inline">\set{0}^*</span> that do not contain 3 consecutive 0.<br />
So <span class="math inline">S = \set{\epsilon, 0, 00}(\set{1}\set{\epsilon, 0, 00})^*</span>. This is still unambiguous because we are simply removing strings we do not want to match.<br />
Since it is unambiguous, <span class="math inline">\Phi_S(x) = (1 + x + x^2) \frac 1 {1 - (x + x^2 + x^3)} = \frac{1 + x + x^2}{1 - x - x^2 - x^3}</span>.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">T</span> be the set of all binary strings where each block has length at least 2. What is the generating series of this set?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can use the <span class="math inline">\set{0}^*(\set{1}\set{1}^*\set{0}\set{0}^*)^*\set{1}^*</span> block decomposition to match these strings.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">T = (\set{00}\set{0}^* \cup \set{\epsilon}))(\set{11}\set{1}^*\set{00}\set{0}^*)^*(\set{11}\set{1}^* \cup \set{\epsilon})</span>.<br />
So <span class="math inline">\Phi_T(x) = \frac{x^2}{}</span> ;wip: <span class="math inline">\Phi_T(x) = \frac{1 - x + x^2}{1 - x - x^2}</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">U</span> be the set of all binary strings where an even block of 0 cannot be followed by an odd block of 1. What is the generating series for this set?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clearly, we can use the <span class="math inline">\set{1}^*(\set{0}\set{0}^*\set{1}\set{1}^*)^*\set{0}^*</span> block decomposition to match these strings (we swapped 0 and 1).<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">U = \set{1}^*(\set{00}\set{00}^*\set{11}\set{11}^* \cup \set{0}\set{00}^*\set{1}\set{1}^*)^*\set{0}^*</span>. We are using two cases - when the block is of even length, and when it is of odd length, and considering each case separately.<br />
Alternatively, we can write this is as <span class="math inline">\set{1}^*(\set{0}\set{0}^*\set{1}\set{1}^* \setminus \set{00}\set{00}^*\set{1}\set{11}^*)^*\set{0}^*</span>, as the set of all blocks minus the set of the blocks we do not want to match.<br />
In that case the sum lemma can be used like a difference lemma: <span class="math inline">A \setminus B</span> implies that <span class="math inline">\Phi_{A \setminus B}(x) = \Phi_A(x) - \Phi_B(x)</span>.<br />
;wip:  We can also represent this using recursion:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Fibonnacci sequence is associated with a denominator of <span class="math inline">1 - x - x^2</span></p>
<p>If a regular expression matches a string, that means the string is contained in the set. A regular expression is just a set.</p>
<p>We can find these sets by starting with one of the unambiguous decompositions of all binary strings, and modifying the regular expression until it no longer matches the strings we do not want in the set.</p>
<h3 id="string-recursion">String Recursion</h3>
<p>Clearly, any binary string consists of either an empty string, or a 0 or a 1 followed by another smaller binary string.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can define the set of all binary strings as <span class="math inline">S = \set{\epsilon} \cup \set{0, 1}S</span>. There is only one way to break a string in this way, so this representation is unambiguous.</p>
<p>So <span class="math inline">\Phi_S(x) = 1 + 2x\Phi_S(x)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\Phi_S(x) = \frac 1 {1 - 2x}</span> and <span class="math inline">[x^n]\frac 1 {1 - 2x} = 2^n</span>.</p>
<h1 id="section-12">4/6/14</h1>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">S</span> be the set of all binary strings with no three consecutive 0. What is the generating series?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, we cut the string starting right after the first 1. Then the part we cut off is also in <span class="math inline">S</span>.<br />
Clearly, the first part can only be 1 or 01 or 001, because there cannot be 3 consecutive 0 and this is the first 1.<br />
So we can represent the string as <span class="math inline">S = \set{1, 01, 001}S \cup \set{\epsilon, 0, 00}</span>, since <span class="math inline">\epsilon, 0, 00</span> are the only possible strings that cannot be represented using the recursion.<br />
So the generating series is <span class="math inline">\Phi_S(x) = (x + x^2 + x^3)\Phi_S(x) + (1 + x + x^2)</span> and <span class="math inline">\Phi_S(x) - (x + x^2 + x^3)\Phi_S(x) = 1 + x + x^2</span>.<br />
So <span class="math inline">(1 - x - x^2 - x^3)\Phi_S(x) = 1 + x + x^2</span> and <span class="math inline">\Phi_S(x) = \frac{1 + x + x^2}{1 - x - x^2 - x^3}</span>.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">S</span> be the set of all binary strings without 1010 as a substring. What is the generating series?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">T</span> be the set of all string with exactly one copy of 1010 at the end.<br />
We want to prove that <span class="math inline">\set{\epsilon} \cup S\set{0, 1} = S \cup T</span>.<br />
Cleary, <span class="math inline">\set{\epsilon} \cup S\set{0, 1} \subseteq S \cup T</span> is true because <span class="math inline">\set{\epsilon} \in S \cup T</span> and either <span class="math inline">S\set{0, 1}</span> has no 1010 (so it is in <span class="math inline">S</span>), or it does and the 1010 is at the end (so it is in <span class="math inline">T</span>).<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">S \cup T \subseteq \set{\epsilon} \cup S\set{0, 1}</span> because any string <span class="math inline">a</span> in <span class="math inline">S</span> is either <span class="math inline">\epsilon</span> or not, in which case removing the last bit get another string <span class="math inline">a</span> implies <span class="math inline">a \in S\set{0, 1}</span>, and because any string <span class="math inline">a</span> in <span class="math inline">T</span> is either epsilon or not, in which case removing the last bit means it has no 1010 and <span class="math inline">a \in S\set{0, 1}</span>.<br />
So <span class="math inline">\set{\epsilon} \cup S\set{0, 1} \subseteq S \cup T</span>.<br />
We want to prove that $S = T <span class="math inline">T\set{10}</span>.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">S\set{1010} \subseteq T \cup T\set{10}</span> any <span class="math inline">a \in S</span> either ends with 10 or not. If not, then <span class="math inline">S\set{1010}</span> has only one instance of 1010, so <span class="math inline">S\set{1010} \in T</span>. If it does, <span class="math inline">S\set{1010}</span> has two copies of 1010 and ends in 101010, so <span class="math inline">S\set{1010} \in T\set{10}</span>.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">T \cup T\set{10} \subseteq S\set{1010}</span> because taking the last four bits off any <span class="math inline">a \in T</span> to get <span class="math inline">a&#39;</span> means that <span class="math inline">a&#39; \in S</span>.<br />
Since <span class="math inline">\set{\epsilon} \cup S\set{0, 1} = S \cup T</span>, <span class="math inline">1 + 2x\Phi_S(x) = \Phi_S(x) + \Phi_T(x)</span>.<br />

Solving, we get <span class="math inline">\Phi_S(x) = \frac 1 {1 - 2x + \frac{x^4}{1 + x^2}} = \frac{1 + x^2}{1 - 2x + x^2 - 2x^3 + x^4}</span>.</p>

<p>In general, <span class="math inline">[x^n]A(x) = a_n = (C_{1, 1}{n + 1 - 1 \choose 1 - 1}r_1^n + \ldots + C_{1, e_1}{n + e_1 - 1 \choose e_1 - 1}r_1^n) + (C_{k, 1}{n + 1 - 1 \choose 1 - 1}r_k^n + \ldots + C_{k, e_k}{n + e_k - 1 \choose e_k - 1}r_k^n)</span>.</p>
<p>Clearly, <span class="math inline">{n + e_i - 1 \choose e_i - 1} = \frac{(n + e_i - 1)!}{(e_i - 1)!n!} = \frac{(n + e_i - 1) \cdots (n + 1)}{(e_i - 1)!}</span>, so it is a polynomial of degree <span class="math inline">e_i - 1</span>.

<p>Let <span class="math inline">A(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty a_nx^n = \frac{6 - x + 5x^2}{1 - 3x^2 - 2x^3}</span>.</p>

Clearly, the characteristic polynomial of the denominator of <span class="math inline">A(x)</span> is <span class="math inline">x^2 - 3x + 2 = (x - 2)(x - 1)</span>.<br />
So there are roots 1 and 2, both with multiplicity 1, and so <span class="math inline">a_n = \alpha 2^n + \beta 1^n</span> for some constants <span class="math inline">\alpha, \beta</span>.<br />

<h3 id="non-homogeneous-recurrences">Non-homogeneous Recurrences</h3>
<p>Homogeneous recurrences are those where the constant term is 0. For example, <span class="math inline">a_n + a_{n - 1} = 0</span> - the right side is 0.</p>
<p>A non-homogeneous recurrence is therefore one that has a non-zero constant term.</p>
<p>For example, <span class="math inline">a_0 = 11, a_1 = 42, a_n - 3a_{n - 1} + 2a_{n - 2} = 10 \times 3^{n - 1}</span>.</p>
<p>Suppose <span class="math inline">b_n</span> satisfies <span class="math inline">b_n - 3b_{n - 1} + 2b_{n - 2} = 10 \times 3^{n - 1}</span> (it has the same recursive part as <span class="math inline">a_n</span>), but does not necessarily satisfy the initial conditions.</p>
<p>Then <span class="math inline">(a_n - b_n) - 3(a_{n - 1} - b_{n - 1}) + 2(a_{n - 2} - b_{n - 2}) = 0</span>. So <span class="math inline">a_n - b_n</span> is a homogeneous version of the recurrence.</p>
<p>So the characteristic polynomial is <span class="math inline">x^2 - 3x + 2 = (x - 2)(x - 1)</span> with roots 1 and 2, so <span class="math inline">a_n - b_n = A1^n + B2^n</span>, so <span class="math inline">a_n = b_n + A + B2^n</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">b_n</span> is called the <strong>specific solution</strong>, and <span class="math inline">A + B2^n</span> is the solution to the homogeneous version. This is reminiscent of LDEs in MATH135, where the general solution to an LDE is a specific solution plus an offset.</p>
<p>We can find <span class="math inline">b_n</span> by using guess and check.</p>
<p>We guess <span class="math inline">b_n = C3^n</span>. Then <span class="math inline">b_n - 3b_{n - 1} + 2b_{n - 2} = C3^n - 3C2^{n - 1} + 2C3^{n - 2} = C3^{n - 2}(3^2 - 3 \cdot 3 + 2) = 2C3^{n - 2}</span>, and <span class="math inline">b_n - 3b_{n - 1} + 2b_{n - 2} = 10 \cdot 3^{n - 1} = 2C3^{n - 2}</span>.</p>
<p>Solving, <span class="math inline">C = 15</span> and <span class="math inline">b_n = C3^n = 15 \cdot 3^n</span>.</p>
<p>So <span class="math inline">a_n = 15 \cdot 3^n + A + B2^n</span>. Now we can solve for <span class="math inline">A</span> and <span class="math inline">B</span>.</p>
<p>Clearly, <span class="math inline">a_0 = 11 = 15 \cdot 3^0 + A + B2^0 = 15 + A + B</span>, so <span class="math inline">A + B = -4</span>. Clearly, <span class="math inline">a_1 = 42 = 15 \cdot 3^1 + A + B2^1 = 45 + A + 2B</span>, so <span class="math inline">A + 2B = -3</span>. So <span class="math inline">A = -5, B = 1</span>.</p>
<p>So <span class="math inline">a_n = 15 \cdot 3^n - 5 + 2^n</span>.</p>
<p>Why did we guess <span class="math inline">b_n = C3^n</span>? We determined this from the generating series.</p>
<p>If we multiply <span class="math inline">b_n - 3b_{n - 1} + 2b_{n - 2} = 10 \times 3^{n - 1}</span> by <span class="math inline">x^n</span> and sum over <span class="math inline">n \ge 2</span>, then we get <span class="math inline">\sum_{n = 2}^\infty (b_nx^n - 3b_{n - 1}x^n + 2b_{n - 2}x^n) = \sum_{n = 2}^\infty 10 \cdot 3^{n - 1}x^n</span>.</p>
<p>So <span class="math inline">\sum_{n = 2}^\infty (b_nx^n - 3b_{n - 1}x^n + 2b_{n - 2}x^n) = \sum_{n = 2}^\infty b_nx^n - 3x\sum_{n = 2}^\infty b_{n - 1}x^{n - 1} + 2x^2\sum_{n = 2}^\infty b_{n - 2}x^{n - 2} = \sum_{n = 2}^\infty b_nx^n - 3x\sum_{n = 1}^\infty b_nx^n + 2x^2\sum_{n = 0}^\infty b_nx^n</span></p>
<p>So <span class="math inline">(1 - 3x + 2x^2)\sum_{n = 0}^\infty b_n x^n = \frac{10}{3} (3^2 x^2) \frac 1 {1 - 3x} = \frac{30x^2}{1 - 3x}</span>. ;wip: no it doesn't...</p>

<h2 id="graph-theory">Graph Theory</h2>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<p>A <strong>graph</strong> is a pair <span class="math inline">G = (V(G), E(G))</span> where <span class="math inline">V(G)</span> is a set of objects called <strong>vertices</strong>, and <span class="math inline">E(G)</span> is a set of unordered pairs of <span class="math inline">V(G)</span> called <strong>edges</strong> (these pairs are basically just 2-subsets of <span class="math inline">V(G)</span>).</p>
<p>For example, <span class="math inline">G = \left(\set{a, b, c, d}, \set{\set{a, b}, \set{b, c}, \set{c, d}, \set{a, d}}\right)</span> is a graph.</p>
<p>We often represent graphs graphically, by drawing the vertices on a 2D surface as labelled circles or dots, and edges as lines or curves connecting the vertices they contain. Graphical representations are not unique - the vertices in the drawing can be arranged arbitrarily on the surface and the edges can be drawn as any kind of curvy line.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">G</span> be a graph. Let <span class="math inline">u, v \in V(G)</span>.</p>
<p>Then <span class="math inline">u</span> and <span class="math inline">v</span> are <strong>adjacent</strong> if there is an edge connecting the two. Formally, <span class="math inline">u, v</span> are adjacent if <span class="math inline">\set{u, v} \in E(G)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">u</span> is adjacent to <span class="math inline">v</span>, then <span class="math inline">u</span> is a <strong>neighbour</strong> of <span class="math inline">v</span>.</p>
<p>The set of all the neighbors of <span class="math inline">u</span> is called the <strong>neighbourhood</strong>. Formally, the neighourhood of <span class="math inline">u</span> is <span class="math inline">\set{v \middle| \set{v} \in \set{e \setminus \set{u} \middle| \set{e \in E(G) \middle| u \in e}}}</span></p>
<p>An edge <span class="math inline">e = \set{u, v}</span> is <strong>incident</strong> with <span class="math inline">u</span> and <span class="math inline">v</span>.</p>
<p>Graphs have lots of applications. For example, modelling computer networks to determine robustness and other properties. Other applications include electronic circuits, electricity and water distribution networks, road maps and navigation, social graphs, and more.</p>
<p>The map colouring problem asks how many colors are needed to shade in a geographical map such that no two adjacent (sharing a border of non-zero length) geopolitical regions have the same colour.</p>
<h1 id="section-16">13/6/14</h1>
<p>The vertices in a graph can be any type of object. We can abbeviate the edge <span class="math inline">\set{u, v}</span> as <span class="math inline">uv</span>.</p>
<p>In this course we only deal with simple graphs - graphs with at most one edge between two vertices (no loops or double edges joining two vertices). Graphs in this course are also finite.</p>
<h2 id="isomorphism">Isomorphism</h2>
<p>Two graphs <span class="math inline">G_1, G_2</span> are <strong>isomorphic</strong> if and only if there is a bijection <span class="math inline">f: V(G_1) \to V(G_2)</span> such that <span class="math inline">uv \in E(G_1) \iff f(u)f(v) \in E(G_2)</span>. If this is the case, then <span class="math inline">f</span> is called an <strong>isomorphism</strong>.</p>
<p>In other words, two graphs are isomorphic if they have the <strong>same structure</strong> - if they have every vertex correspend to each other, and the edges in one graph connect the corresponding vertices in the other graph.</p>
<p>Two graphs can have multiple possible isomorphisms, or none at all, in which case they are not isomorphic.</p>
<p>Basically, a graph <span class="math inline">G_2</span> that is isomorphic to a graph <span class="math inline">G_1</span> can be created from <span class="math inline">G_1</span> by replacing its vertices with vertices in <span class="math inline">G_2</span>.</p>
<p>The isomorphism preserves the edge structure, so edges are mapped to edges, and non-edges are mapped to non-edges.</p>
<p>We can detect isomorphism informally by moving the vertices around until the two graphs resemble each other.</p>
<p>Checking if two graphs are isomorphic can be done in polynomial time, using recently developed algorithms.</p>
<p>To prove two graphs are isomorphic, we find an isomorphism. To prove two graphs are not isomorphic, we find a structure in one graph that is not in the other.</p>
<p>The degree of a vertex <span class="math inline">u</span> in <span class="math inline">G</span> is the number of edges incident with it. The degree of a vertex is <span class="math inline">\deg_G(v) = \abs{\set{e \in E(G) \middle| v \in e}}</span>.</p>
<p>The sum of the degrees of every vertex in a graph <span class="math inline">G</span> has a special meaning and is <span class="math inline">\sum_{u \in V(G)} \deg_G(u)</span>. The sum is always even because every edge <span class="math inline">\set{u, v}</span> increases both <span class="math inline">\deg_G(u)</span> and <span class="math inline">\deg_G(v)</span> by 1. This is called the <strong>handshaking lemma</strong>, and <span class="math inline">\sum_{u \in V(G)} \deg_G(u) = 2 \abs{E(G)}</span>.</p>
<p>As a result, the number of odd-degree vertices must always be even.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">O</span> be the subset of vertices in <span class="math inline">G</span> with odd degree and <span class="math inline">E</span> the subset with even degree.<br />
Then <span class="math inline">\sum_{u \in V(G)} \deg_G(u) = \sum_{v \in O} \deg_G(v) + \sum_{v \in E} \deg_G(v) = 2\abs{E(G)}</span>.<br />
Since <span class="math inline">2\abs{E(G)}</span> and <span class="math inline">\sum_{v \in E} \deg_G(v)</span> are even (sum of even numbers is even), <span class="math inline">\sum_{v \in O} \deg_G(v)</span> must also be even.<br />
Since every <span class="math inline">\deg_G(v)</span> in <span class="math inline">\sum_{v \in O} \deg_G(v)</span> is odd, <span class="math inline">\sum_{v \in O} \deg_G(v)</span> can only be even if <span class="math inline">\abs{O}</span> is even.<br />
So there are an even number of odd vertices.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="section-17">16/6/14</h1>
<p>A <strong>cycle</strong> is a closed path through three or more vertices (for the simple graphs we are using in this course).</p>
<p>A graph <span class="math inline">G</span> is <span class="math inline">k</span>-regular if every vertex has a degree of <span class="math inline">k</span> - <span class="math inline">\forall v \in V(G), \deg(v) = k</span>. So a 0-regular graph has no edges, and a 1-regular graph has pairs of vertices joined by edges (these are also called matchings). 2-regular graphs have their vertices all connected by a closed path of edges, called a collection of cycles. A 3-regular graph does not lend itself to a simple description, and so on.</p>
<p>Clearly, the sum of vertices in a <span class="math inline">k</span>-regular graph is <span class="math inline">\sum_{v \in V(G)} \deg(v) = \abs{V(G)}k</span>, so by the handshaking lemma <span class="math inline">\abs{E(G)} = \frac{\abs{V(G)}k}{k}</span>.</p>
<p>A graph <span class="math inline">G</span> is <strong>complete</strong> if every pair of vertices in <span class="math inline">G</span> is joined by an edge. A complete graph with <span class="math inline">n</span> vertices is represented by <span class="math inline">k_n</span>. Therefore the number of edges is the same as the number of pairs of vertices. There are <span class="math inline">n \choose 2</span> pairs, so there are <span class="math inline">n \choose 2</span> edges in <span class="math inline">k_n</span>.</p>
<p>Also, <span class="math inline">k_n</span> is <span class="math inline">(n - 1)</span>-regular, because each vertex must connect with <span class="math inline">n - 1</span> other vertices.</p>
<p>A partition of a set <span class="math inline">S</span> is a pair <span class="math inline">(A, B)</span> such that <span class="math inline">A \cup B = S, A \cap B = \emptyset</span>. In other words, a way of dividing the set into two groups.</p>
<p>A graph <span class="math inline">G</span> is <strong>bipartite</strong> if there is a partition of <span class="math inline">V(G)</span> into <span class="math inline">(A, B)</span> such that <span class="math inline">G</span> has every edge in <span class="math inline">\set{\set{u, v} \middle| u \in A, v \in B}</span>. In other words, if there is a partition such that the edges go between the two partitioned areas, but not within the partitioned areas. The two partitions do not necessarily have the same size and can even be empty.</p>
<p>We prove a graph is bipartite by giving the partition, and we prove that a graph is not bipartite by contradiction - assuming that one vertex is in partition <span class="math inline">A</span>, any vertex connected by an edge must be in <span class="math inline">B</span>, and we try to derive a contradiction where a vertex is in <span class="math inline">A</span> yet also in <span class="math inline">B</span>, since <span class="math inline">A \cap B = \emptyset</span>.</p>
<p>Any graph containing a cycle containing an odd number of vertices cannot be bipartite. Every graph is either bipartite, or has a cycle with an odd number of vertices.</p>
<p>A graph <span class="math inline">G</span> is a <strong>complete bipartite graph</strong> if <span class="math inline">G</span> is bipartite with partitions <span class="math inline">(A, B)</span> and has every edge in <span class="math inline">\set{\set{u, v} \middle| u \in A, v \in B}</span>. In other words, a biparitite graph with every possible pair of vertices with one from <span class="math inline">A</span> and one from <span class="math inline">B</span> are connected by edges. A complete bipartite graph with <span class="math inline">\abs{A} = m, \abs{B} = n</span> is represented by <span class="math inline">k_{m, n}</span>.</p>
<p>Every vertex of <span class="math inline">A</span> must be connected with every element of <span class="math inline">B</span>, and every element of <span class="math inline">B</span> must be connected with every element of <span class="math inline">A</span>, so the total number of edges in <span class="math inline">k_{m, n}</span> is <span class="math inline">mn</span>. The degree of every vertex in <span class="math inline">A</span> is <span class="math inline">n</span> and the degree of every vertex in <span class="math inline">B</span> is <span class="math inline">m</span>.</p>
<h2 id="n-cubes">N-cubes</h2>
<p>An <span class="math inline">n</span>-cube is a graph where the vertices are all binary strings of length <span class="math inline">n</span> and two vertices are connected by an edge if and only if they differ by one bit. The 1-cube looks like a line, the 2-cube looks like a square, and the 3-cube looks like a 2D projection of a 3D cube.</p>
<h1 id="section-18">18/6/14</h1>
<p>The <span class="math inline">n</span>-cube has <span class="math inline">2^n</span> vertices, and is always an <span class="math inline">n</span>-regular graph. It is regular because there are always <span class="math inline">n</span> ways to have a binary string differ by 1 bit, so every binary string is connected to <span class="math inline">n</span> other binary strings.</p>
<p>By the handshaking lemma, there are <span class="math inline">\frac 1 2 n2^n = n2^{n - 1}</span> edges in an <span class="math inline">n</span>-cube. The <span class="math inline">n</span>-cube is also bipartite, because it is impossible for any cycles with odd numbers of vertices to exist in the graph.</p>
<p>For example, a 3-cube can be partitioned into <span class="math inline">\left(\set{000, 101, 110, 011}, \set{001, 100, 111, 010}\right)</span>. In general, one parition has all binary strings with an even number of 1, and the other has those with an odd number of 1. This is because any binary string differs with another by one bit if and only if it has one less 1 or one more 1 than the other. Therefore, no two binary strings with an even number of 1 can differ by 1 bit, and no two binary strings with an odd number of 1 can differ by 1 bit. Therefore, this partition shows that the <span class="math inline">n</span>-cube is bipartite.</p>
<p>It is possible to recursively construct the <span class="math inline">n</span>-cube. First, the 0-cube is a single vertex, <span class="math inline">\epsilon</span>. Given an <span class="math inline">n</span>-cube, we can find the graph for the <span class="math inline">(n + 1)</span>-cube by making two copies of the <span class="math inline">n</span>-cube (with a 0 prepended to every string in the first copy and 1 prepended to every string in the second copy), and then joining the corresponding vertices of the two copies (which now differ by 1 bit since we prepended different values in each copy).</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">n</span>-cube is an <span class="math inline">n</span>-dimensional analogue of a cube. A 2D drawing of a 4-cube is a 2D projection of a tesseract.</p>
<p>Also, any finite graph can be represented in 3D space such that there are no crossing edges. This is difficult to prove, however.</p>
<h2 id="walkspaths">Walks/Paths</h2>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">u, w</span> be vertices of a graph <span class="math inline">G</span>.</p>
<p>Given vertices <span class="math inline">u, w</span>, a <span class="math inline">u, w</span> <strong>walk</strong> is a sequence of alternating vertices and edges <span class="math inline">u, e_1, v_1, e_2, v_2, \ldots, e_{k - 1}, v_{k - 1}, e_k, w</span>, where <span class="math inline">v_1, \ldots, v_k</span> are vertices and <span class="math inline">e_i, 1 \le i \le k</span> is the edge <span class="math inline">\set{v_{i - 1}, v_i}</span>. The length of this walk is <span class="math inline">k</span> - the number of edges in the walk.</p>
<p>This is also written <span class="math inline">u = v_0, e_1, v_1, e_2, v_2, \ldots, e_{k - 1}, v_{k - 1}, e_k, v_k = w</span> or just <span class="math inline">v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_{k - 1}, v_k</span>.</p>
<p>The walk is <strong>closed</strong> if <span class="math inline">u = v</span> - if it begins the same place it ends. There can also be duplicated vertices or edges.</p>
<p>Since we only deal with simple graphs in this course, it is possible to represent a walk just by its vertices. So a walk of a 3-cube might be written as <span class="math inline">000, 001, 000, 100, 101</span>.</p>
<p>A walk of length 0 just contains one vertex. For example, <span class="math inline">000</span> is a zero-length walk of the 3-cube.</p>
<p>A <span class="math inline">u, w</span> <strong>path</strong> is a walk with no repeated vertices or edges. As a result, a path cannot be closed. All <span class="math inline">u, w</span> paths are <span class="math inline">u, w</span> walks.</p>
<p>All walks can be converted into paths. If we can get somewhere by repeating vertices, then we can also just not repeat those vertices and get to the same place.</p>
<h1 id="section-19">20/6/14</h1>
<p>Prove that if there exists a <span class="math inline">u, v</span> walk, then there must also exist a <span class="math inline">u, v</span> path:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">u, w_1, \ldots, w_{k - 1}, v</span> be a <span class="math inline">u, v</span> walk of shortest length.<br />
If there are no repeated vertices, then it is a <span class="math inline">u, v</span> path.<br />
Otherwise, let <span class="math inline">v_i</span> be the first instance of the first repeated vertex, so <span class="math inline">\exists j &gt; i, v_j = v_i</span>.<br />
Then <span class="math inline">u, v_1, \ldots, w_i, w_{j + 1}, \ldots, v</span> is a walk as well.<br />
However, this is shorter than the original walk, which is the shortest possible walk, which is a contradiction.<br />
Therefore, the shortest <span class="math inline">u, w</span> walk cannot have any repeated vertices, and it is a path.<br />
Therefore, one of the $$</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="math inline">u \sim v</span> is an equivalence relation. In graph theory, <span class="math inline">u \sim v</span> if and only if there exists a <span class="math inline">u, v</span> path.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">u \sim v</span> and <span class="math inline">v \sim w</span>, then <span class="math inline">u \sim w</span> - <span class="math inline">\sim</span> is transitive. This is because a <span class="math inline">u, v</span> path followed by a <span class="math inline">v, w</span> path is a <span class="math inline">u, w</span> walk, so by the previous theorem there must be a <span class="math inline">u, w</span> path.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\sim</span> is reflexive - <span class="math inline">u \sim u</span> is true for any vertex <span class="math inline">u</span>. <span class="math inline">\sim</span> is also symmetric <span class="math inline">u \sim v</span> implies that <span class="math inline">v \sim u</span>.</p>
<p>We can then partition <span class="math inline">V(G)</span> into equivalence classes (groups of vertices such that for every vertex <span class="math inline">u</span> and every vertex <span class="math inline">v</span>, <span class="math inline">u \sim v</span>). These partitions are called <strong>components</strong> and are basically islands of vertices where every vertex is connected to the group by at least one edge.</p>
<p>A <strong>cycle</strong> is a non-trivial closed walk with no repeated vertices and edges. Nontrivial means it has two or more vertices in the walk.</p>
<p>A cycle must have a length of 3 or more, because it is impossible to construct a cycle with 1 vertex (which is trivial) or 2 (which would repeat vertices). The degree of the vertices in a cycle must be at least 2.</p>
<p>Prove that if every vertex in <span class="math inline">G</span> has a degree of 2 or more, then <span class="math inline">G</span> must have a cycle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is because if we go into a vertex, there must be a way out of the vertex, so eventually we must hit a repeated vertex.<br />
Let <span class="math inline">v_0, \ldots, v_k</span> be the longest path in <span class="math inline">G</span>. Assume every vertex in <span class="math inline">G</span> has a degree of 2 or more.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">v_k</span> has neighbor <span class="math inline">v_{k - 1}</span>, and it has a degree of 2 or more, so it must have at least one other neighbor <span class="math inline">u</span>.<br />
Clearly, if <span class="math inline">u</span> is not one of <span class="math inline">v_0, \ldots, v_k</span>, then <span class="math inline">v_0, \ldots, v_k, u</span> is a longer path, a contradiction.<br />
So <span class="math inline">u</span> must be one of <span class="math inline">v_0, \ldots, v_k</span>. Since <span class="math inline">u</span> cannot be <span class="math inline">v_k</span> or <span class="math inline">v_{k - 1}</span> (because <span class="math inline">v_{k - 1}</span> is already another neighbor), <span class="math inline">u</span> is in <span class="math inline">\set{v_0, \ldots, v_{k - 2}}</span>.<br />
So there exists some <span class="math inline">i</span> such that <span class="math inline">v_i = u</span>, and <span class="math inline">v_i, \ldots, v_k</span> is a cycle.</p>

<p>A <strong>Hamilton cycle</strong> is a cycle that contains every vertex in the graph. Finding a Hamilton cycle for an arbitrary graph, or even if it exists, is an NP-complete problem. This is because it can be reduced to the travelling salesman problem.</p>
<p>All complete graphs have Hamiltonian cycles. ;wip: prove it</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">G</span> is a graph with <span class="math inline">\abs{V(G)} \ge 3</span>, and every vertex in <span class="math inline">G</span> has a degree of <span class="math inline">\frac{n}{2}</span> or more, then <span class="math inline">G</span> has a Hamilton cycle. The converse is not necessarily true.</p>
<h1 id="section-20">23/6/14</h1>
<p>;wip: pidgeonhole principle</p>
<p>Given a graph <span class="math inline">G</span>, <span class="math inline">G - e</span> is <span class="math inline">G</span> with the edge <span class="math inline">e</span> removed. Formally, <span class="math inline">G - e</span> is a graph such that <span class="math inline">V(G - e) = V(G)</span> and <span class="math inline">E(G - e) = E(G) \setminus e</span>.</p>
<p>In the same way, <span class="math inline">G + e</span> is <span class="math inline">G</span> with the edge <span class="math inline">e</span> added. Formally, <span class="math inline">G + e</span> is a graph such that <span class="math inline">V(G + e) = V(G)</span> and <span class="math inline">E(G + e) = E(G) \cup e</span>.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">G</span> be a graph with <span class="math inline">\abs{V(G)} \ge 3</span> where every vertex in <span class="math inline">G</span> has a degree of <span class="math inline">\frac{n}{2}</span> or more.<br />
Suppose <span class="math inline">G</span> has no Hamilton cycle. Then there must be a set of counterexamples <span class="math inline">S_n</span> with <span class="math inline">n</span> vertices for some <span class="math inline">n</span>.<br />
Let <span class="math inline">G \in S_n</span> be the graph with the largest number of edges - the largest possible counterexample with <span class="math inline">n</span> vertices.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">G</span> cannot be complete because <span class="math inline">G</span> would have a Hamilton cycle if it was.<br />
Since it is not complete, there exist <span class="math inline">u, v \in V(G)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\set{u, v} \notin E(G)</span> - there exists a pair of vertices that are not adjacent.<br />
So <span class="math inline">G + \set{u, v}</span> has more edges than the largest counterexample, so it is not a counterexample and must have a Hamilton cycle.<br />
This Hamilton cycle in <span class="math inline">G + \set{u, v}</span> must use <span class="math inline">\set{u, v}</span>, so there must be a <span class="math inline">\set{u, v}</span> path <span class="math inline">P = v_1, \ldots, v_n, v_1 = u, v_n = v</span> in <span class="math inline">G</span> that contains all the vertices in <span class="math inline">G</span>, made by removing <span class="math inline">\set{u, v}</span> from the Hamilton cycle in <span class="math inline">G + \set{u, v}</span>.<br />
Let <span class="math inline">S = \set{i - 1 \middle| \set{v_1, v_i} \in E(G)}, S = \set{i \middle| \set{v_i, v_n} \in E(G)}</span> - the indices of the neighbors of <span class="math inline">v_1</span> and <span class="math inline">v_n</span>, respectively.<br />
Since all vertices have degree of at least <span class="math inline">\frac n 2</span>, <span class="math inline">\abs{S} \ge \frac n 2, \abs{T} \ge \frac n 2</span>.<br />
Since <span class="math inline">S, T \subseteq [n - 1]</span> (since <span class="math inline">v_1</span> cannot be connected to <span class="math inline">v_n</span>), by the Pidgeonhole principle, there is some <span class="math inline">i</span> for which <span class="math inline">i \in S \cap T</span>.<br />
So <span class="math inline">\set{v_1, v_{i + 1}}, \set{v_i, v_n} \in E(G)</span>. So <span class="math inline">v_1, v_{i + 1}, \ldots, v_n, v_i, \ldots, v_1</span> is a Hamiltonian cycle.<br />
This is a contradiction because <span class="math inline">G</span> has no Hamilton cycle. So <span class="math inline">G</span> has a Hamilton cycle.</p>

<p>A graph <span class="math inline">G</span> is <strong>connected</strong> if there is a <span class="math inline">u, v</span> path for every pair of vertices <span class="math inline">u, v \in V(G)</span>. This means that given any two vertices in the graph, it is possible to construct a path between them.</p>
<p>A disconnected graph is the opposite. A disconnected graph has groups of vertices that have no edges between them.</p>
<p>If there are <span class="math inline">n</span> vertices, there are <span class="math inline">\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}</span> possible pairs of vertices. However, we can save a lot of time by checking fewer pairs.</p>
<p>If there exists a vertex <span class="math inline">u \in V(G)</span> such that a <span class="math inline">u, v</span> path exists for all <span class="math inline">v \in V(G)</span>, then <span class="math inline">G</span> is connected. The converse is also true but is trivially proven.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assume <span class="math inline">u \in V(G)</span> exists such that a <span class="math inline">u, v</span> path exists for all <span class="math inline">v \in V(G)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">y, z \in V(G)</span>.<br />
So a <span class="math inline">u, y</span> path and a <span class="math inline">u, z</span> path exists, so if we join them together, we have a <span class="math inline">y, z</span> walk.<br />
Since there is a <span class="math inline">y, z</span> walk, there is a <span class="math inline">y, z</span> path.<br />
Since <span class="math inline">y, z</span> are arbitrary and a <span class="math inline">y, z</span> path exists, <span class="math inline">G</span> is connected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We prove a graph is connected by showing that there is a path between one particular vertex and every other vertex, possibly by constructing the path. We prove a graph by constructing a set <span class="math inline">X \subset V(G), X \ne \emptyset</span> that induces an empty cut.</p>
<p>For example, the <span class="math inline">n</span>-cube is connected because for any <span class="math inline">u, v</span>, a <span class="math inline">u, v</span> path exists where we flip the bits of <span class="math inline">u</span> that differ from <span class="math inline">v</span> one by one to match <span class="math inline">v</span>. For example, a path between <span class="math inline">0000000</span> and <span class="math inline">1001100</span> would be <span class="math inline">0000000, 1000000, 1001000, 1001100</span>.</p>

<p>A subgraph of a graph <span class="math inline">G</span> is a graph <span class="math inline">H</span> such that <span class="math inline">V(H) \subseteq V(G)</span> and <span class="math inline">E(H) \subseteq \set{\set{u, v} \in E(G) \middle| u, v \in V(G)}</span>. In other words, a graph with a subset of the vertices and the same edges between these vertices as <span class="math inline">G</span>.</p>
<p>A <strong>component</strong> of a graph <span class="math inline">G</span> is a maximally connected non-empty subgraph of <span class="math inline">G</span>. In other words, each island of connected vertices in a graph is a component. A component must be the largest possible network of vertices that are all connected.</p>
<p>Clearly, a connected graph must have exactly 1 component (unless it is empty, which has 0 components). Therefore, a disconnected graph has 2 or more components.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">G</span> is a graph and <span class="math inline">X \subseteq V(G)</span>, then the <strong>cut induced by <span class="math inline">X</span></strong> is the set of all edges in <span class="math inline">G</span> with exactly one end in <span class="math inline">X</span> - <span class="math inline">\set{\set{u, v} \in E(G) \middle| u \in X \wedge v \notin X}</span>. It is basically the set of all edges that bridge the vertices in <span class="math inline">X</span> with everything else it is connected to.</p>
<p>For a connected graph, if <span class="math inline">X \subset V(G), X \ne \emptyset</span>, then the cut induced by <span class="math inline">X</span> is non-empty. This is because <span class="math inline">X</span> doesn't contain all the vertices, and it must be connected to the other vertices in some way.</p>
<p>There always exists a set <span class="math inline">X \subseteq V(G), X \ne \emptyset</span> that induces an empty cut. For example, the components of a graph always induce empty cuts, and so does the entire graph itself.</p>
<p>Therefore, a graph is not connected if and only if there exists <span class="math inline">X \subset V(G), X \ne \emptyset</span> such that <span class="math inline">X</span> induces an empty cut.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>

<p>Assume <span class="math inline">G</span> is a disconnected graph. Then <span class="math inline">G</span> contains two or more components. Let <span class="math inline">H</span> be one of these components.<br />
Since <span class="math inline">H</span> is a component, <span class="math inline">V(H) \ne \emptyset</span> and <span class="math inline">V(H) \subset V(G)</span> (since there is another component in <span class="math inline">G</span>).<br />
Suppose the cut induced by <span class="math inline">V(H)</span> is non-empty. Then there is an edge <span class="math inline">\set{u, v}</span> such that <span class="math inline">u \in V(H)</span> but <span class="math inline">v \notin V(H)</span>.<br />
So <span class="math inline">\set{v} \cup V(H)</span> is still connected, which is a contradiction since <span class="math inline">H</span> is maximally connected. So <span class="math inline">V(H)</span> induces an empty cut.<br />
Assume there exists <span class="math inline">X \subset V(G), X \ne \emptyset</span> such that <span class="math inline">X</span> induces an empty cut.<br />
Suppose <span class="math inline">G</span> is connected. Then there exists <span class="math inline">u, v \in V(G)</span> such that <span class="math inline">u \in X \wedge v \notin X</span>. Since <span class="math inline">G</span> is connected, there exists a <span class="math inline">u, v</span> path.<br />
Let <span class="math inline">u, v_1, \ldots, v_k, v</span> be the shortest path from <span class="math inline">u</span> to <span class="math inline">v</span>. Let <span class="math inline">i</span> be the smallest value such that <span class="math inline">v_i \notin X</span>.<br />
Then <span class="math inline">v_{i - 1} \in X</span> and <span class="math inline">\set{v_{i - 1}, v_i}</span> is in the cut, which is a contradiction since the cut is empty. So <span class="math inline">G</span> is not connected.<br />
So <span class="math inline">G</span> is not connected if and only if there exists <span class="math inline">X \subset V(G), X \ne \emptyset</span> such that <span class="math inline">X</span> induces an empty cut.</p>

<p>A cut is drawn as a line through the edges in the cut. If it is empty, the line is drawn separating the inducing set and the rest of the graph.</p>

<h2 id="eulerian-circuits">Eulerian Circuits</h2>
<p>The problem of Eulerian circuits was the first one ever published, by Euler. In fact, it was the first graph theory problem as well.</p>
<p>The problem is determining whether given a graph, there exists a closed walk that uses every edge exactly once. This was originally posed in the form of whether it is possible to cross bridges across cities and end up in the same place again, crossing each bridge exactly once.</p>
<p>An <strong>Eulerian circuit</strong> is a closed walk that uses every edge exactly once.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">G</span> be a graph having an Eulerian circuit. Then either <span class="math inline">G</span> is connected, or there are vertices with degree 0.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">G</span> be a connected graph. Then <span class="math inline">G</span> has an Eulerian circuit if and only if every vertex has even degree.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assume <span class="math inline">G</span> has an Eulerian circuit. Then a closed walk adds 2 to the degree of a vertex each time it visits.<br />
Since it uses all edges exactly once and <span class="math inline">G</span> is connected, each vertex is visited, so each vertex has even degree.<br />
This is because every time we enter a vertex, we must be able to leave it. This means that each time we visit a vertex, we increase its degree by 2, so the degree must be even.<br />
Assume every vertex in <span class="math inline">G</span> has even degree.<br />
Suppose <span class="math inline">\abs{E(G)} = n = 0</span>. Clearly, <span class="math inline">G</span> is still connected, so it has only one vertex, so it has an Eulerian circuit containing only the one vertex.<br />
Assume for some <span class="math inline">k \ge n</span> that for all <span class="math inline">\abs{E(G)} &lt; k</span>, <span class="math inline">G</span> has an Eulerian circuit. Suppose <span class="math inline">\abs{E(G)} = k</span>.<br />
Construct a walk <span class="math inline">W = v_1, v_2, \ldots</span>, where we keep randomly walking without repeating edges until we can no longer continue.<br />
When we cannot continue, we must have returned to <span class="math inline">v_1</span>, because anytime we enter a vertex, we are able to leave it due to the degree being even. So <span class="math inline">W = v_1, \ldots, v_{k - 1}, v_1</span>.<br />
If <span class="math inline">W</span> includes all edges, then it is an Eulerian circuit. If it does not, then remove the edges in <span class="math inline">W</span> from <span class="math inline">G</span> to get <span class="math inline">G&#39;</span>.<br />
Clearly, every vertex in <span class="math inline">G&#39;</span> also has even degree, since every vertex in the walk has an even degree.<br />
Let <span class="math inline">C_1, \ldots, C_j</span> be the components of <span class="math inline">G&#39;</span>. Let <span class="math inline">1 \le i \le j</span>. Clearly, every <span class="math inline">C_i</span> is connected and by the inductive hypothesis, has an Eulerian circuit.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">W</span> must have a vertex <span class="math inline">v_{a_i}</span> that is also in <span class="math inline">C_i</span>, because otherwise <span class="math inline">G</span> would have been disconnected.<br />
Let <span class="math inline">E_i</span> be the Eulerian circuit in <span class="math inline">C_i</span> that starts at <span class="math inline">v_{a_i}</span>.<br />
Then <span class="math inline">W&#39; = v_1, \ldots, v_{a_1 - 1}, E_1, v_{a_1 + 1}, \ldots, v_{a_2 - 1}, E_2, v_{a_2 + 1}, \ldots, v_{k - 1}, v_1</span> is an Eulerian circuit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To find an Eulerian circuit, we use a greedy algorithm where we keep walking the graph randomly, until we can no longer walk. Because all the degrees of the vertices are even, we can only get stuck at the original node we started at. Now we have a walk that does not necessarily cover all the edges, so we modify our walk to have detours until it covers all the edges.</p>

<h2 id="bridges">Bridges</h2>
<p>An edge <span class="math inline">e</span> in a graph <span class="math inline">G</span> is a <strong>bridge/cut-edge/isthmus</strong> in <span class="math inline">G</span> if and only if removing <span class="math inline">e</span> from <span class="math inline">G</span> would increase the number of components in <span class="math inline">G</span>. In other words, bridges are the only edge connecting two islands together.</p>
<p>A bridge is basically a weak point in a graph - if we cut it, two parts of the graph become separated.</p>
<p>Removing an edge increases the number of components by at most 1.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">e = \set{u, v}</span> is a bridge in connected graph <span class="math inline">G</span>, then <span class="math inline">G</span> with <span class="math inline">e</span> removed has 2 components, and <span class="math inline">u</span> and <span class="math inline">v</span> are in different components.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">e</span> be a bridge. Clearly, <span class="math inline">G - e</span> has at least 2 components since <span class="math inline">G</span> contains 1.<br />
Let <span class="math inline">H</span> be the component of <span class="math inline">G - e</span> containing <span class="math inline">u</span>. Since <span class="math inline">H</span> is a component, the cut induced by <span class="math inline">V(H)</span> is empty.<br />
Suppose <span class="math inline">v \in V(H)</span>. Then the cut induced by <span class="math inline">V(H)</span> is also empty in <span class="math inline">G</span>, since <span class="math inline">e</span> does not cross the cut.<br />
This is a contradiction, since then <span class="math inline">G</span> has more than one component, so <span class="math inline">v</span> is in a different component from <span class="math inline">u</span>.<br />
Suppose there is a third component <span class="math inline">J</span> in <span class="math inline">G - e</span>. Then the cut induced by <span class="math inline">V(J)</span> is empty in <span class="math inline">G</span> and <span class="math inline">G - e</span>, since removing/adding <span class="math inline">e</span> does not affect the cut.<br />
This is a contradiction since then <span class="math inline">G</span> would not be connected, so there are only two components.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An edge <span class="math inline">e = \set{u, v}</span> is a bridge in <span class="math inline">G</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">e</span> is not in any cycle of <span class="math inline">G</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assume <span class="math inline">e = \set{u, v}</span> is a bridge in <span class="math inline">G</span>. Suppose <span class="math inline">e</span> is in a cycle in <span class="math inline">G</span>.<br />
Then if we remove <span class="math inline">e</span> from the cycle, <span class="math inline">u</span> and <span class="math inline">v</span> are still in the same component, because we can go the long way around the cycle.<br />
So by the above theorem, since they are in the same component, <span class="math inline">e</span> is not a bridge, a contradiction. So <span class="math inline">e</span> is not in any cycle of <span class="math inline">G</span>.<br />
Assume <span class="math inline">e</span> is not in any cycle of <span class="math inline">G</span>. Suppose <span class="math inline">e</span> is not a bridge.<br />
Let <span class="math inline">H</span> be the component of <span class="math inline">G</span> containing <span class="math inline">e</span>. Then <span class="math inline">H</span> with <span class="math inline">e</span> removed is still a single component, so it is connected.<br />
So there is a <span class="math inline">u, v</span> path <span class="math inline">v_1, \ldots, v_n</span> in <span class="math inline">H</span> with <span class="math inline">e</span> removed that is also in <span class="math inline">H</span>, so <span class="math inline">v_1, \ldots, v_n, v_1</span> is a cycle, since <span class="math inline">u</span> and <span class="math inline">v</span> are connected by an edge in <span class="math inline">H</span>.<br />
So <span class="math inline">e</span> is in a cycle in <span class="math inline">G</span>, a contradiction, so <span class="math inline">e</span> is a bridge.</p>

<h2 id="trees">Trees</h2>
<p>A <strong>tree</strong> is a connected graph with no cycles. A <strong>forest</strong> is a graph with no cycles, and can possibly be disconnected. Each component of a forest is a tree.</p>
<p>Every edge in a tree is a bridge, because there are no cycles in a tree. So a tree is <strong>minimally connected</strong>, since if we removed any edge, it would no longer be connected.</p>
<p>A <strong>leaf</strong> in a tree is a vertex with degree 1. All trees with 2 or more vertices has 2 or more leaves.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">v_1, \ldots, v_n</span> be the longest path in tree <span class="math inline">T</span>.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">v_1</span> has no neighbors other than <span class="math inline">v_2</span> since if it had any neighbor outside the path, the path would not be the longest, and if it had a neighbor inside the path, there would be a cycle.<br />
Suppose <span class="math inline">v_1</span> has a neighbor <span class="math inline">v</span> other than <span class="math inline">v_2</span>.<br />
If <span class="math inline">v \in \set{v_1, \ldots, v_n}</span>, then there is a cycle, a contradiction.<br />
If <span class="math inline">v \notin \set{v_1, \ldots, v_n}</span>, then the path <span class="math inline">v, v_1, \ldots, v_n</span> is longer than the longest path, a contradiction.<br />
So <span class="math inline">v</span> cannot exist, and <span class="math inline">v_1</span> has only one neighbor <span class="math inline">v_2</span>. A similar argument can be made for <span class="math inline">v_n</span> having only <span class="math inline">v_{n - 1}</span> as a neighbor.<br />
So <span class="math inline">v_1</span> and <span class="math inline">v_n</span> are leaves, and there are at least 2 leaves in <span class="math inline">T</span>.</p>

<p>A tree <span class="math inline">T</span> with <span class="math inline">n \ge 1</span> vertices has <span class="math inline">n - 1</span> edges:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">n</span> be the number of vertices in a tree <span class="math inline">T</span>.<br />
Clearly, for <span class="math inline">n = 1</span> there is 1 vertex and 0 edges, so there are <span class="math inline">n - 1</span> edges.<br />
Assume for some <span class="math inline">k \ge 1</span> that for <span class="math inline">n = k</span>, there are <span class="math inline">n - 1</span> edges.<br />
Assume <span class="math inline">n = k + 1</span>. Let <span class="math inline">v</span> be a leaf in <span class="math inline">T</span> and <span class="math inline">e</span> be an edge incident with <span class="math inline">v</span>.<br />
By the previous theorem, <span class="math inline">v</span> and <span class="math inline">e</span> exist for all <span class="math inline">n \ge 2</span>.<br />
Let <span class="math inline">T&#39;</span> be <span class="math inline">T</span> with <span class="math inline">v</span> and <span class="math inline">e</span> removed. Clearly, <span class="math inline">T&#39;</span> cannot have cycles since <span class="math inline">T</span> has no cycles and we only removed things.<br />
Clearly, removing <span class="math inline">e</span> from <span class="math inline">T</span> results in a graph with two components since <span class="math inline">e</span> is a bridge, and one of the components is just <span class="math inline">v</span> by itself.<br />
So <span class="math inline">T&#39;</span> has only one component, and so it is connected. So <span class="math inline">T&#39;</span> is a tree as well.<br />
Since <span class="math inline">T&#39;</span> has <span class="math inline">k</span> vertices, by assumption it has <span class="math inline">k - 1</span> edges.<br />
Since <span class="math inline">k = n - 1</span>, <span class="math inline">T&#39;</span> has <span class="math inline">n - 1</span> vertices and <span class="math inline">n - 2</span> edges. Since <span class="math inline">T</span> has one more edge and vertex than <span class="math inline">T&#39;</span>, it has <span class="math inline">n</span> vertices and <span class="math inline">n - 1</span> edges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same way, a forest with <span class="math inline">n</span> vertices and <span class="math inline">k</span> components has <span class="math inline">n - k</span> components, because each component is a tree with one less edge than the number of vertices, so overall there are <span class="math inline">k</span> less edges than vertices.</p>
<p>For a tree <span class="math inline">T</span> and two vertices <span class="math inline">u, v \in V(T)</span>, there is a unique <span class="math inline">u, v</span> path. The path exists because <span class="math inline">T</span> is connected by definition, and the path is unique because if it wasn't, there would exist cycles in <span class="math inline">T</span>, which is not possible.</p>
<p>A tree is always bipartite. This can be proven using induction over the number of vertices - removing a leaf and prove smaller tree satisfies inductive hypothesis and so is bipartite, then prove that the original tree is bipartite using the smaller tree.</p>
<p>A <strong>spanning tree</strong> <span class="math inline">T</span> of a graph <span class="math inline">G</span> is a subgraph of <span class="math inline">G</span> that is a tree and <span class="math inline">V(T) = V(G)</span>. In other words, a tree that uses all the vertices of <span class="math inline">G</span>. A spanning tree connects all the vertices together with the smallest possible number of edges.</p>
<p>A graph <span class="math inline">G</span> has a spanning tree if and only if it is connected.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assume <span class="math inline">G</span> has a spanning tree <span class="math inline">T</span>. Let <span class="math inline">u, v \in V(G)</span>. Since the spanning tree is connected, there is a <span class="math inline">u, v</span> path in <span class="math inline">T</span>. Since <span class="math inline">T</span> is a subgraph of <span class="math inline">G</span>, this path is also a <span class="math inline">u, v</span> path in <span class="math inline">G</span>.<br />
Assume <span class="math inline">G</span> is connected. We will then use induction on the number of cycles <span class="math inline">n</span> to show that when we remove edges of cycles, we get fewer cycles but the graph is still connected.<br />
Clearly, if <span class="math inline">n = 0</span> there are no cycles, so <span class="math inline">G</span> is a tree and <span class="math inline">G</span> is a spanning tree of <span class="math inline">G</span>.<br />
Assume for some <span class="math inline">k \ge 0</span> that for <span class="math inline">n \le k</span>, <span class="math inline">G</span> has a spanning tree.<br />
Assume <span class="math inline">n = k + 1</span>. Let <span class="math inline">v_1, \ldots, v_i, v_n</span> be a cycle in <span class="math inline">G</span>. Let <span class="math inline">e</span> be an edge in <span class="math inline">v_1, \ldots, v_i, v_n</span>.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">e</span> is not a bridge because it is in a cycle. Clearly, <span class="math inline">G - e</span> is still connected, but has fewer cycles since we removed an edge in a cycle.<br />
Then <span class="math inline">G - e</span> contains a spanning tree <span class="math inline">T</span>. Since <span class="math inline">G</span> has the same vertices as <span class="math inline">G - e</span>, <span class="math inline">G</span> has the spanning tree <span class="math inline">T</span>, by induction.</p>

<h1 id="section-25">7/7/14</h1>
<p>Basically, we can find the spanning tree of a graph by identifying cycles and removing edges from those cycles until there are no more cycles.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">G</span> is connected with <span class="math inline">n</span> vertices and <span class="math inline">n - 1</span> edges if and only if <span class="math inline">G</span> is a tree. This is useful for determining whether a graph is a tree.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assume <span class="math inline">G</span> is connected with <span class="math inline">n</span> vertices and <span class="math inline">n - 1</span> edges. Then <span class="math inline">G</span> has a spanning tree <span class="math inline">T</span>. Clearly, <span class="math inline">T</span> has <span class="math inline">n - 1</span> edges.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">G</span> has <span class="math inline">n - 1</span> edges too, so <span class="math inline">G = T</span> and <span class="math inline">G</span> is a tree.<br />
The other direction was proved earlier via induction on the number of vertices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if we add an edge to a tree with <span class="math inline">n</span> vertices and remove another, the resulting graph is still a tree because it has <span class="math inline">n - 1</span> vertices.</p>
<p>If we add an edge to a tree, we always create exactly one cycle (with other graphs it could make more than 1 edges). This is because when we add an edge to a tree, the new cycles must pass through both vertices in the edge. Since there is exactly one path between any two vertices in a tree, there is only one cycle.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">G</span> is a graph with <span class="math inline">n</span> vertices, <span class="math inline">T</span> is a spanning tree of <span class="math inline">G</span>, and <span class="math inline">e \in E(G) \setminus E(T)</span>, then <span class="math inline">T</span> with <span class="math inline">e</span> added has exactly one cycle.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">e = \set{u, v}</span>. Clearly, <span class="math inline">G</span> must have at least one cycle since there are <span class="math inline">n</span> edges.<br />
Clearly, there is only one path in <span class="math inline">T</span> from <span class="math inline">u</span> to <span class="math inline">v</span>. So this path with <span class="math inline">e</span> added forms a cycle.<br />
There cannot be another cycle because all cycles must include <span class="math inline">u, v</span>.</p>

<p>A graph <span class="math inline">G</span> is bipartite if and only if every component of <span class="math inline">G</span> is bipartite.</p>
<p>A graph <span class="math inline">G</span> is bipartite if and only if every subgraph of <span class="math inline">G</span> is bipartite. So if <span class="math inline">G</span> contains something that is not bipartite, <span class="math inline">G</span> itself is not bipartite.</p>
<p>Also, all trees are bipartite.</p>
<p>A graph <span class="math inline">G</span> is bipartite if and only if <span class="math inline">G</span> does not contain any odd cycles. An odd cycle is a cycle with an odd number of edges.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>

<p>Assume <span class="math inline">G</span> is bipartite with partitions <span class="math inline">(a, b)</span>. Suppose <span class="math inline">G</span> contains a cycle of odd length <span class="math inline">v_1, \ldots, v_k, v_1</span>.<br />
Without loss of generality, assume <span class="math inline">v_1 \in A</span>. Then by induction, <span class="math inline">v_k \in A</span>, a contradiction since <span class="math inline">v_1</span> is adjacent to <span class="math inline">v_k</span>.<br />
So <span class="math inline">G</span> does not contain any odd cycles.<br />
Assume <span class="math inline">G</span> does not contain any odd cycles. Suppose <span class="math inline">G</span> is not bipartite.<br />
Then there exists a component <span class="math inline">H</span> of <span class="math inline">G</span> that is not bipartite, since if there wasn't, all components would be bipartite and so would <span class="math inline">G</span>.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">H</span> has a spanning tree <span class="math inline">T</span> and <span class="math inline">T</span> is bipartite with partitions <span class="math inline">(A, B)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">H</span> is not bipartite, there is an edge <span class="math inline">\set{u, v}</span> such that <span class="math inline">u, v \in A</span> or <span class="math inline">u, v \in B</span>.<br />
Without loss of generality, assume <span class="math inline">u, v \in A</span>. Clearly, there is a <span class="math inline">u, v</span> path <span class="math inline">u, \ldots, v</span> in <span class="math inline">T</span> and this is also in <span class="math inline">H</span>. Clearly, the length of the path is even since it alternates between <span class="math inline">A</span> and <span class="math inline">B</span> and has both ends in <span class="math inline">A</span>.<br />
So <span class="math inline">u, \ldots, v, u</span> is a cycle of odd length, a contradiction since <span class="math inline">G</span> has no odd cycles.<br />
So <span class="math inline">G</span> is bipartite.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">G</span> be a connected graph where each edge <span class="math inline">e</span> has an associated weight <span class="math inline">w: E(G) \to \mb{R}</span>. Then the <strong>minimimum spanning tree</strong> is the spanning tree <span class="math inline">T</span> such that the sum of all the edge weights <span class="math inline">w(T) = \sum_{e \in E(T)} w(e)</span> is minimized. This gives a lower bound on the cost of connecting all the vertices.</p>
<p>We originally found spanning trees by removing edges in cycles until no cycles are left. For minimum spanning trees, we can either continually remove an edge in a cycle with the largest cost, or we can use <strong>Prim's algorithm</strong>, which grows the tree from a single vertex.</p>
<p>Basically, Prim's algorithm starts at an arbitrary vertex and repeatedly adds edges to the tree such that it grows the smallest possible amount in that step.</p>
<p>We can write it formally as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Let <span class="math inline">w \in V(G)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">T</span> be a tree containing only <span class="math inline">w</span>.</li>
<li>While <span class="math inline">V(T) \ne V(G)</span>:
<ol type="1">
<li>Let <span class="math inline">C</span> be the cut induced by <span class="math inline">V(T)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\set{u, v} \in C</span> where <span class="math inline">w(u, v)</span> is minimised - the edge with the lowest weight in the cut.</li>
<li>Add <span class="math inline">v</span> to <span class="math inline">V(T)</span> and <span class="math inline">\set{u, v}</span> to <span class="math inline">E(T)</span>.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Prove that Prim's algorithm always give the minimum spanning tree:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">T_1, \ldots, T_n</span> be the trees produced while executing Prim's algorithm. Let <span class="math inline">e_1, \ldots, e_n</span> be the edges we added in each step, so <span class="math inline">T_i</span> with <span class="math inline">e_i</span> added is <span class="math inline">T_{i + 1}</span>. We want to prove that for each <span class="math inline">T_i</span>, there exists a minimum spanning tree that contains <span class="math inline">T_i</span>.<br />
Suppose that this minimum spanning tree does not exist. Let <span class="math inline">k</span> be the largest integer for which <span class="math inline">T_1, \ldots, T_k</span> are all within minimum spanning trees.<br />
So <span class="math inline">T_k</span> is in a minimum spanning tree <span class="math inline">T&#39;</span>, while <span class="math inline">T_{k + 1}</span> is not.<br />
Let <span class="math inline">C</span> be the cut induced by <span class="math inline">V(T_k)</span>.<br />
Since <span class="math inline">T_{k + 1}</span> is <span class="math inline">T_k</span> with <span class="math inline">e_k</span> added and <span class="math inline">T_{k + 1}</span> is not in <span class="math inline">T&#39;</span>, <span class="math inline">e_k \notin T&#39;</span>.<br />
So <span class="math inline">T&#39;</span> with <span class="math inline">e_k</span> added must contain a cycle <span class="math inline">v_1, \ldots, v_j</span> containing <span class="math inline">e_k</span>.<br />
Clearly, this cycle contains an edge <span class="math inline">e&#39; \in C</span> since the edge must loop back into <span class="math inline">T_k</span>.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">e_k</span> is the edge in <span class="math inline">C</span> with the lowest possible <span class="math inline">w(e)</span>, so <span class="math inline">w(e_k) \le w(e&#39;)</span>.<br />
Let <span class="math inline">V</span> be <span class="math inline">T&#39;</span> with <span class="math inline">e_k</span> removed and <span class="math inline">e&#39;</span> added. Clearly, <span class="math inline">V</span> is also a spanning tree, where <span class="math inline">w(T&#39;) = w(V) + w(e_k) - w(e&#39;)</span>.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">V</span> contains <span class="math inline">T_{k + 1}</span> and is a minimum spanning tree. ;wip: why? This is a contradiction since <span class="math inline">T_{k + 1}</span> is not in any minimum spanning trees. So for each <span class="math inline">T_i</span>, there exists a minimum spanning tree that contains <span class="math inline">T_i</span>.<br />
Since <span class="math inline">V(T_n) = V(G)</span>, and a minimum spanning tree contains <span class="math inline">T_n</span>, <span class="math inline">T_n</span> is a minimum spanning tree.</p>

<p>A <strong>planar embedding</strong> of a graph <span class="math inline">G</span> is a drawing of <span class="math inline">G</span> on a plane such that every vertex has a unique position and the edges do not intersect except at vertices.</p>
<p>Any graph that has at least one planar embedding is a <strong>planar graph</strong>. A <strong>face</strong> in a planar graph is a connected region (empty area) on the plane - a region which, considered by itself, is connected.</p>
<p>The <strong>boundary walk</strong> for a face in a <strong>connected</strong> planar embedding is a closed walk around the boundary of the face. This is basically a walk that encloses the face but nothing else. For example, if there is a face within a face, we have to exclude the inner face from being included in the outer face's boundary walk.</p>
<p>Note that the boundary walk is undefined for disconnected graphs.</p>
<p>The <strong>degree</strong> of a face is the length of the boundary walk - the number of edges that it has surrounding it. The sum of the degrees of every face is even and twice the number of edges - because every edge is in two faces, every edge increases the degree of two faces it is beside by 1.</p>
<p>A face is <strong>incident</strong> to an edge if the edge is in the boundary walk. A face is incident to a vertex if the vertex is in the boundary walk. Two faces are <strong>adjacent</strong> if they share at least one edge in their boundary walk.</p>
<p>The <strong>handshaking lemma for faces</strong> (HLFF) states that given a graph <span class="math inline">G</span> with a planar embedding with set of faces <span class="math inline">F</span>, <span class="math inline">\sum_{f \in F} \deg(f) = 2\abs{E(G)}</span>.</p>
<p>An edge has two different faces on both sides if and only if it is part of a cycle. So an edge has the same face on both sides if it is a bridge. This is because if we have a cycle in a planar representation, it must partition the plane into an inside and outside. The edge must therefore have one side on the inside and the other on the outside.</p>
<p>This was formalized in the Jordan Curve Theorem: every simple closed curve on the plane separates it into two parts, the inside and the outside. This might not be true on surfaces other than a plane, like on the surface of a torus.</p>
<p>A connected graph with a planar embedding and only one face must be a tree, since if it had any cycles it would have 2 or more faces.</p>
<p>In a connected graph with a planar embedding and at least 2 faces, every face boundary walk contains a cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Euler's formula</strong> relates the number of vertices, edges, and faces to each other. Let <span class="math inline">G</span> be a connected graph with a planar embedding and <span class="math inline">F</span> be the set of faces in <span class="math inline">G</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\abs{V(G)} - \abs{E(G)} + \abs{F(G)} = 2</span>. In other words, the number of vertices plus the number of faces minus the number of edges always results in 2.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Induction over fixed <span class="math inline">\abs{V(G)}</span> and induction on <span class="math inline">\abs{E(G)}</span>. Let <span class="math inline">F(H)</span> be the set of faces in a graph <span class="math inline">H</span>.<br />
Clearly, the smallest possible connected graph with a planar embedding is a tree, so it is one such that <span class="math inline">\abs{E(G)} = \abs{V(G)} - 1</span>. Since there is only one face, <span class="math inline">\abs{V(G)} - \abs{E(G)} + \abs{F(G)} = \abs{V(G)} - (\abs{V(G)} - 1) + 1 = 2</span>.<br />
Suppose for some <span class="math inline">k</span> that for all <span class="math inline">\abs{E(G)} &lt; k</span>, <span class="math inline">\abs{V(G)} - \abs{E(G)} + \abs{F(G)} = 2</span>.<br />
Assume <span class="math inline">\abs{E(G)} = k</span>. Let <span class="math inline">e</span> be an edge in a cycle, which must exist because graph has more than <span class="math inline">\abs{V(G)} - 1</span> edges and is not a tree.<br />
Then <span class="math inline">G - e</span> is also connected and planar, since <span class="math inline">e</span> is in a cycle and is therefore not a bridge.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">G - e</span> has <span class="math inline">\abs{F(G)} - 1</span> faces, since <span class="math inline">e</span> was in a cycle and had two different faces on both sides, and removing <span class="math inline">e</span> merges them into one face.<br />

<h2 id="platonic-solids">Platonic Solids</h2>
<p>A graph has an embedding in a plane if and only if it has an embedding on a sphere. Any embedding on the sphere can be turned into a polyhedron by cutting faces out of the sphere.</p>
<p>A graph is <strong>platonic</strong> if and only if it is planar and every vertex has the same degree, and every face has the same degree.</p>
<p>Assume <span class="math inline">G</span> is platonic with <span class="math inline">n</span> vertices, <span class="math inline">m</span> edges, and <span class="math inline">s</span> faces. Then every vertex has degree <span class="math inline">d_V \ge 3</span> and every face has degree <span class="math inline">d_F \ge 3</span>.</p>
<p>Clearly, <span class="math inline">2m = nd_V</span> by handshaking lemma, <span class="math inline">sd_F = 2m</span> by HLFF, and <span class="math inline">\frac{2m}{d_V} - m + \frac{2m}{d_F}</span>. So <span class="math inline">m(2d_F - d_Vd_F + 2d_V) = 2d_Vd_F</span>, and <span class="math inline">2d_Vd_F &gt; 0</span>.</p>
<p>So <span class="math inline">0 &lt; 2d_F - d_Vd_F + 2d_V + 4 - 4</span>, so <span class="math inline">0 &lt; 4 - (d_V - 2)(d_F - 2)</span>. So <span class="math inline">(d_V - 2)(d_F - 2) &lt; 4</span>.</p>
<p>Clearly, the only possible solutions are <span class="math inline">(d_V, d_F) = (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (5, 3)</span>, since <span class="math inline">d_V \ge 3, d_F \ge 3</span>.</p>
<p>These are the five possible platonic graphs - planar graphs with every vertex of degree <span class="math inline">d_V</span> and every face of degree <span class="math inline">d_F</span>. These are polyhedrons when embedded onto a sphere and form very regular solids.</p>
<p>When <span class="math inline">d_V = 3, d_F = 3</span>, <span class="math inline">G</span> is a <strong>tetrahedron</strong> and each face is a triangle.</p>
<p>When <span class="math inline">d_V = 3, d_F = 4</span>, <span class="math inline">G</span> is a <strong>cube/hexahedron</strong> and each face is a square.</p>
<p>When <span class="math inline">d_V = 3, d_F = 5</span>, <span class="math inline">G</span> is a <strong>dodecahedron</strong> and each face is a pentagon.</p>
<p>When <span class="math inline">d_V = 4, d_F = 3</span>, <span class="math inline">G</span> is an <strong>octahedron</strong> and each face is a triangle.</p>
<p>When <span class="math inline">d_V = 5, d_F = 3</span>, <span class="math inline">G</span> is an <strong>icosahedron</strong> and each face is a triangle.</p>
<p>We can quickly draw the planar embedding of a platonic solid by drawing the shape of the face and making sure there is a face shape adjacent to every other face shape until the conditions are satisfied.</p>
<p>These are the only platonic graphs. Things like 100-sided die are possible only because the faces can possibly be different shapes. For example, bevelling every vertex of an icosahedron results in a Buckyball (truncated icosahedron), a shape with hexagons and pentagons.</p>
<h2 id="planarity">Planarity</h2>
<p>A non-planar graph cannot be embedded onto a plane without any edges crossing - it has at least one edge crossing no matter how we draw it. We can prove a graph is non-planar by constructing this crossing for an arbitrary graph drawing, or by using the theorems below.</p>
<p>We can prove a graph is not planar by proving that it contains a nonplanar graph, or by showing it has too many edges. For example, <span class="math inline">K_5</span> (complete graph with 5 vertices) is nonplanar.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">n \ge 3</span>, then all planar graphs with <span class="math inline">n</span> vertices have at most <span class="math inline">3n - 6</span> edges. So if it has more than <span class="math inline">3n - 6</span> edges, it is not planar. Also, if <span class="math inline">n \le 3</span> then <span class="math inline">G</span> is always planar.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">G</span> be a planar graph with <span class="math inline">n</span> vertices, <span class="math inline">m</span> edges, and <span class="math inline">s</span> faces, where <span class="math inline">n \ge 3</span>.<br />
Clearly, if <span class="math inline">G</span> has no cycles, then <span class="math inline">G</span> is a tree and <span class="math inline">m = n - 1</span>, so <span class="math inline">m \le 3n - 6</span>.<br />
Otherwise, assume <span class="math inline">G</span> has a cycle. Clearly, every face contains a cycle in its boundary, so it has degree at least 3.<br />
So by HLFF, <span class="math inline">2m \ge 3s</span> and <span class="math inline">2m \ge 3(2 - n + m)</span> by Euler's formula, so <span class="math inline">m \le 3n - 6</span>, as required.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if a graph is planar, it has less than or equal to <span class="math inline">3n - 6</span> edges. The converse is not necessarily true - it is possible to have a non-planar graph with less than or equal to <span class="math inline">3n - 6</span> edges.</p>
<h1 id="section-29">16/7/14</h1>
<p>If <span class="math inline">G</span> is a connected bipartite planar graph with <span class="math inline">n \ge 3</span> vertices, then <span class="math inline">G</span> has at most <span class="math inline">2n - 4</span> edges.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose <span class="math inline">G</span> has <span class="math inline">n</span> vertices, <span class="math inline">m</span> edges, and <span class="math inline">s</span> faces.<br />
Clearly, if <span class="math inline">G</span> has no cycles, then <span class="math inline">G</span> is a tree and <span class="math inline">m = n - 1</span>, so <span class="math inline">m \le 2n - 4</span>. Assume <span class="math inline">G</span> has a cycle.<br />
Clearly, every face boundary in <span class="math inline">G</span> contains a cycle, and every face must have at least 3 vertices, and bipartite graphs cannot have cycles of odd length, so the degree of each face is 4 or more.<br />
By HLFF, <span class="math inline">2m \ge \sum_{f \in F(G)} 4</span>, so <span class="math inline">2m \ge 4s</span>. By Euler's formula, <span class="math inline">2m \ge 4(2 - n + m)</span> and <span class="math inline">m \le 2n - 4</span>.</p>

<p>So a bipartite graph has a tighter upper bound on the number of edges before it becomes non-planar.</p>
<h3 id="kuratowskis-theorem">Kuratowski's Theorem</h3>
<p>An <strong>edge subdivision</strong> of a graph <span class="math inline">G</span> is obtained by replacing each edge <span class="math inline">\set{u, v} \in E(G)</span> with a <span class="math inline">u, v</span> path of length at least 1. In other words, we add vertices <span class="math inline">v_1, \ldots, v_k</span> into the graph and replace each <span class="math inline">\set{u, v} \in E(G)</span> with <span class="math inline">\set{u, w}</span> and <span class="math inline">w, v</span> for a unique <span class="math inline">w \in \set{v_1, \ldots, v_k}</span>.</p>
<p>Basically, we are subdividing edges in a graph to get a new subdivided graph. Clearly, an edge subdivision is planar if and only if the original graph is planar.</p>
<p><strong>Kuratowski's theorem</strong> states that a graph <span class="math inline">G</span> is planar if and only if it does not have any edge subdivision of <span class="math inline">K_5</span> or <span class="math inline">K_{3, 3}</span> as a subgraph.</p>
<p>We can use this to prove a graph is not planar, by finding a subgraph that is an edge subdivision of <span class="math inline">K_5</span> or <span class="math inline">K_{3, 3}</span>. To prove a graph is planar, we just draw its planar embedding.</p>
<h1 id="section-30">18/7/14</h1>
<p>A <span class="math inline">k</span>-colouring of a graph is an assignment of a colour to each vertex using at most <span class="math inline">k</span> colours, such that any two adjacent vertices have different colours.</p>
<p>If a graph has a <span class="math inline">k</span>-colouring, then it is <span class="math inline">k</span>-colourable.</p>
<p>In general, what is the minimum <span class="math inline">k</span> for which a graph is <span class="math inline">k</span>-colourable - what is the minimum number of colours we need to colour the graph such that any two adjacent vertices have different colours?</p>
<p>Clearly, <span class="math inline">K_n</span> is <span class="math inline">n</span>-colourable but not <span class="math inline">(n - 1)</span>-colourable, since every vertex is connected to <span class="math inline">n - 1</span> others, so we need one color for each vertex. Clearly, bipartite graphs are 2-colourable.</p>
<p>A graph with vertices of degree at most <span class="math inline">d</span> is <span class="math inline">(d + 1)</span>-colourable. This can be proven using induction where the inductive step is removing a vertex of degree <span class="math inline">d</span> and showing that this new graph uses <span class="math inline">d</span> or fewer colours, so the original graph has at most 1 more colour than that.</p>
<p>We are usually more interested in planar graph, however. This is more useful for things like map colouring and other real-world problems.</p>
<p>Ever planar graph has a vertex of degree at most 5. In other words, there exists a vertex in any planar graph that has a degree less than or equal to 5.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">G</span> be a planar graph with <span class="math inline">n</span> vertices. Suppose every vertex in <span class="math inline">G</span> has degree at least 6. Then <span class="math inline">\sum_{v \in V(G)} \deg v \ge 6n</span> and <span class="math inline">\abs{E(G)} \ge 3n</span> by the handshaking lemma.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">3n &gt; 3n - 1</span> so <span class="math inline">G</span> is not planar, a contradiction. So there exists a vertex in <span class="math inline">G</span> with degree at most 5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every planar graph is 6-colourable.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">G</span> be a graph with <span class="math inline">n</span> vertices. Clearly, if <span class="math inline">n = 0</span>, <span class="math inline">G</span> has no vertices and is 6-colourable.<br />
Assume for some <span class="math inline">k \ge 0</span> that if <span class="math inline">n = k</span>, <span class="math inline">G</span> is 6-colourable.<br />
Assume <span class="math inline">n = k + 1</span>. Let <span class="math inline">v</span> be a vertex of degree at most 5 in <span class="math inline">G</span>, which must exist by the previous theorem.<br />
Clearly, if we remove <span class="math inline">v</span> from <span class="math inline">G</span> to get <span class="math inline">G&#39;</span>, <span class="math inline">G&#39;</span> has <span class="math inline">k</span> vertices and is therefore 6-colourable.<br />
Construct a colouring for <span class="math inline">G</span> where we use the same colours as <span class="math inline">G&#39;</span> for every vertex except <span class="math inline">v</span>, where <span class="math inline">v</span> is coloured using a different colour.<br />
Clearly, this different colour exists because <span class="math inline">v</span> has at most 5 neighbours and therefore is only unable to use at most 5 of the 6 colours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <strong>contraction</strong> on an edge <span class="math inline">e = \set{u, v}</span> in <span class="math inline">G</span> is a graph <span class="math inline">G/e</span> where <span class="math inline">V(G&#39;) = ((V(G) \setminus u) \setminus v) \cup w</span> where <span class="math inline">w</span> is a new vertex, and <span class="math inline">E(G&#39;) = \set{e \in E(G) \middle| u \notin e \wedge v \notin e} \cup \set{\set{w} \cup ((e \setminus u) \setminus v) \middle| e \in \set{e \in E(G) \middle| u \in e \vee v \in e}}</span>. Basically, a contraction on an edge is a graph with the vertices of that edge merged into one vertex, and the edge removed.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">G</span> is planar, then <span class="math inline">G/e</span> is also planar, because we could feed the edges its vertices connect to through the same space the edge used to occupy.</p>
<p>Every planar graph is 5-colourable.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">G</span> be a planar graph with <span class="math inline">n</span> vertices. Clearly, if <span class="math inline">n = 0</span> then <span class="math inline">G</span> has no vertices and is therefore 5-colourable.<br />
Assume for some <span class="math inline">k \ge 0</span> that for any <span class="math inline">n \le k</span>, <span class="math inline">G</span> is 5-colourable.<br />
Assume <span class="math inline">n = k + 1</span>. Let <span class="math inline">v</span> be a vertex of degree at most 5 in <span class="math inline">G</span>, which was proved to exist.<br />
Clearly, if <span class="math inline">\deg v \le 4</span>, then there are 4 or fewer neighbours of <span class="math inline">v</span>, so <span class="math inline">v</span> cannot use at most 4 colours and there is a colour <span class="math inline">v</span> can use, by the same argument as the proof of 6-colouring.<br />
Assume <span class="math inline">\deg v = 5</span>. Clearly, <span class="math inline">v</span> has two neighbours <span class="math inline">x, y</span> that are not adjacent, since otherwise <span class="math inline">G</span> would contain <span class="math inline">K_5</span> as a subgraph and would not be planar.<br />
Let <span class="math inline">H = (G / \set{v, x}) / \set{v, y}</span> - <span class="math inline">G</span> with <span class="math inline">\set{v, x}</span> and <span class="math inline">\set{v, y}</span> contracted.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">H</span> is planar and has <span class="math inline">n - 2</span> vertices, so <span class="math inline">H</span> is 5-colourable.<br />
Construct a colouring for <span class="math inline">G</span> with the same colours as <span class="math inline">H</span> for every vertex except <span class="math inline">v, x, y</span>, where <span class="math inline">x, y</span> are coloured using the colour of the contracted vertex (vertex created from the contraction) and <span class="math inline">v</span> uses a different colour.<br />
Clearly, the 5 neighbours of <span class="math inline">v</span> use at most 4 colours, so <span class="math inline">v</span> cannot use at most 4 colours, so there is an available colour for <span class="math inline">v</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every planar graph is 4-colourable. The proof of this was found by computer assisted proof tools and is extremely difficult for humans to understand.</p>
<p>Planar graphs are not all 3-colourable. For example, the planar projection of a triangular prism where there are concentric triangles is not 3-colourable. So 4 is the lowest number of colours that can be used to colour any planar graph.</p>
<h1 id="section-31">21/7/14</h1>
<h2 id="graph-duals">Graph Duals</h2>
<p>The <strong>dual</strong> of a planar graph <span class="math inline">G</span> is a graph <span class="math inline">G*</span> where <span class="math inline">G*</span> has one vertex <span class="math inline">v_f</span> for each <span class="math inline">f \in F(G)</span>, and for all <span class="math inline">e \in E(G)</span> incident to faces <span class="math inline">f_1, f_2</span>, <span class="math inline">G*</span> has an edge <span class="math inline">\set{v_{f_1}, v_{f_2}}</span>.</p>
<p>To draw the dual of a graph, we draw a vertex in the center of each face, and then connect the vertices of those faces that are adjacent. It is important to remember to consider the outer face - the area outside of the whole graph - since it is also a face.</p>
<p>For example, the dual of the top-down projection of the pentagonal-based pyramid is the same graph, though this is not true in general.</p>
<p>The dual of a planar graph can contain multiple edges connecting the same vertices, and even loops. We get a loop when we have <span class="math inline">f_1 = f_2</span> or duplicate pairs of <span class="math inline">f_1</span> and <span class="math inline">f_2</span>. For example, a triangle graph has a center vertex with three edges connecting it to a vertex outside of the triangle. This is because there are three edges incident to both the inside and outside faces, so there are three corresponding edges in the dual.</p>
<p>The dual of a planar graph is also planar. This is because dual can be drawn by putting lines from each face's vertex to the midpoints, and then joining the faces at the edges. Since all these operations do not intersect each other, the dual must be planar.</p>
<p>The dual of the dual of a planar graph, <span class="math inline">G^{**}</span>, is simply <span class="math inline">G</span>.</p>
<p>It is always true that <span class="math inline">\abs{V(G^*)} = \abs{F(G)}</span>, <span class="math inline">\abs{E(G^*)} = \abs{E(G)}</span>, and <span class="math inline">\abs{F(G^*)} = \abs{V(G)}</span>. In other words, the dual of the graph has a vertex for each face, an edge for an edge, and a face for each vertex.</p>
<p>The dual of a platonic solid is also a platonic solid, not necessarily the same one. For example, the dual of a tetrahedron is a tetrahedron, the dual of a cube in the octahedron, and the dual of a dodecahedron is an icosahedron.</p>
<p>Every planar graph is 4-face colourable - we can colour the faces such that no two adjacent faces have the same colour. This is provable by using the 4-color theorem to show that the dual is 4-colourable in vertices, so the original graph is 4-colourable in faces.</p>
<h2 id="matchings">Matchings</h2>
<p>A <strong>matching</strong> of a graph <span class="math inline">G</span> is a set of edges <span class="math inline">M \subseteq E(G)</span> such that no two edges share a common vertex. In other words, the edges form a subgraph where the maximum degree of each vertex is 1.</p>
<p>It is easy to find matchings in a graph - the empty set is a matching of any graph. We are more interested in the largest possible matching of a given graph - one that includes the largest possible number of edges. This is a maximum matching.</p>
<p>A <strong>perfect matching</strong> is a matching where the vertices in the matching include every vertex in the graph - a matching that separates every vertex. This is always the largest possible matching in a given graph, but the largest possible matching is not always a perfect matching. For example, a graph with an odd number of vertices.</p>
<p>In a matching, a <strong>saturated vertex</strong> is one that is incident to an edge in the matching. A vertex is saturated if and only if it is incident to an edge in the matching.</p>
<p>An <strong>alternating path</strong> <span class="math inline">v_1, e_1, \ldots, e_{k - 1}, v_k</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">M</span> is a path in which each edge <span class="math inline">e_1, \ldots, e_{k - 1}</span> alternates between being in M and not being in <span class="math inline">M</span>.</p>
<p>An <strong>augmenting path</strong> is an alternating path that starts and ends with unsaturated vertices. For an augmenting path, we can switch the alternation of the path, so those edges that were in the matching are not, and those that weren't in the matching are. When we do this, all the vertices in the augmented path are saturated, and the number of edges in the matching increases by 1.</p>
<p>If there exists an augmenting path with respect to a matching <span class="math inline">M</span>, then <span class="math inline">M</span> is not a maximum matching. This is because the matching with the augmenting path where the alternation is flipped is a larger matching.<br />
# 23/7/14</p>
<p>If there are no augmenting paths with regard to a matching <span class="math inline">M</span>, then <span class="math inline">M</span> is a maximum matching.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assume there are no augmented paths with respect to <span class="math inline">M</span>.<br />
Suppose <span class="math inline">M</span> is not a maximum matching. Then there exists a matching <span class="math inline">M&#39;</span> such that <span class="math inline">\abs{M&#39;} &gt; \abs{M}</span>. Let <span class="math inline">N</span> be the set of edges that are in <span class="math inline">M</span> or <span class="math inline">M&#39;</span> but not both.<br />
Clearly, each vertex in <span class="math inline">N</span> has degree at most 2, since it is joined to at most 1 vertex in <span class="math inline">M</span> and 1 in <span class="math inline">M&#39;</span>.<br />
Clearly, every component in <span class="math inline">N</span> is either a path or a cycle, and all cycles must be of even length since they must alternate between being in <span class="math inline">M</span> and being in <span class="math inline">M&#39;</span>.<br />
Since <span class="math inline">\abs{M&#39;} &gt; \abs{M}</span>, there must be a path with more edges in <span class="math inline">M&#39;</span> than <span class="math inline">M</span>.<br />
Clearly, the two ends of this path are not saturated by <span class="math inline">M</span> since it must start and end with edges in <span class="math inline">M&#39;</span>.<br />
So there exists an augmented path with respect to <span class="math inline">M</span>, a contradiction.<br />
Therefore, <span class="math inline">M</span> is a maximum matching.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is often difficult to prove that a matching has no augmented paths. Instead, we use the concept of vertex covers.</p>
<p>A <strong>vertex cover</strong> <span class="math inline">C \subseteq V(G)</span> of a graph <span class="math inline">G</span> is a set of vertices such that every edge in <span class="math inline">G</span> has at least one endpoint in <span class="math inline">C</span> - <span class="math inline">\forall \set{u, v} \in E(G), u \in C \vee v \in C</span>.</p>
<p>We are again interested in minimizing - specifically, minimizing the size of <span class="math inline">C</span>. This is related to the problem of finding the maximum matching in that every vertex in the minimum matching can have at most one edge in the maximum matching.</p>
<p>In fact, given a matching <span class="math inline">M</span> in <span class="math inline">G</span>, any vertex over <span class="math inline">C</span> satisfies <span class="math inline">\abs{M} \le \abs{C}</span>.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clearly, <span class="math inline">\forall \set{u, v} M, u \in C \vee v \in C</span>. Clearly, distinct edges in <span class="math inline">M</span> have distinct endpoints, so the vertices that cover <span class="math inline">M</span> are all distinct. So <span class="math inline">\abs{M} \le \abs{C}</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result, if we find a vertex cover and a matching that have the same size, we have found a maximum matching and a minimum vertex cover. So to prove that a matching is maximal, we can find a vertex cover of the same size, and to prove a vertex cover is minimal, we can find a matching of the same size.</p>
<p>It is not always possible to prove using this method, because the maximum matching can also be smaller than the minimum cover. For example, the endwise projection of a triangular prism has a maximum matching of size 3 and a minimum vertex cover of size 4. However, bipartite graphs always have a matching <span class="math inline">M</span> and a vertex cover <span class="math inline">C</span> such that <span class="math inline">\abs{M} = \abs{C}</span>.</p>
<h1 id="section-32">25/7/14</h1>
<p><strong>König's theorem</strong> states that in a bipartite graph, the size of the maximum matching is equal to the size of the minimum cover. ;wip: umlaut o</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will find an algorithm that finds the maximum cover and minimum cover. We start from a set of unsaturated vertices and find all possible alternating paths.<br />
Let <span class="math inline">G</span> be a bipartite graph with bipartitions <span class="math inline">(A, B)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">M</span> be a matching.<br />
Clearly, if there is an augmenting path that starts in <span class="math inline">A</span>, the path must end in <span class="math inline">B</span>, since all augmented paths must be of odd length.<br />
The basic idea is that we start with the set of unsaturated vertices in one parition, and then follow all their matching neighbors as <span class="math inline">X</span>, then follow all their unmatched neighbors as <span class="math inline">Y</span>, and so on, until we either find an augmenting path or run out of vertices.<br />
Start with all vertices in <span class="math inline">G</span> being unsaturated. Let <span class="math inline">X_0</span> be the set of all unsaturated vertices in <span class="math inline">A</span>.<br />
Let <span class="math inline">X, Y</span> be sets of vertices. Let <span class="math inline">X</span> start off as <span class="math inline">X_0</span>.<br />
Find all neighbors of <span class="math inline">X</span> that are not in <span class="math inline">Y</span>. If these neighbors are all saturated, put them in <span class="math inline">Y</span> and add their matching neighbors in <span class="math inline">X</span>. Repeat for every vertex in <span class="math inline">X</span>.<br />
If there is a neighbor that is not saturated, then we have an augmenting path in <span class="math inline">G</span>, so we update <span class="math inline">M</span> (make the matched edges unmatched and unmatched edges matched in the augmented path) and start the algorithm again from the beginning.<br />
If there are no new neighbors, then <span class="math inline">M</span> is the maximum matching and <span class="math inline">Y \cup (A \setminus X)</span> is a minimum cover.<br />
;wip: rewrite this so it makes sense Clearly, <span class="math inline">Y</span> is saturated since if it had any unsaturated, there would be an augmenting path.<br />
Clearly, all vertices in <span class="math inline">A \setminus X</span> are saturated, since all unsaturated vertices are in <span class="math inline">X</span>.<br />
Clearly, no edges join <span class="math inline">Y</span> to <span class="math inline">A \setminus X</span> since both are saturated, and none of the vertices in <span class="math inline">Y</span> or <span class="math inline">A \setminus X</span> are adjacent to each other.<br />
So <span class="math inline">Y \cup (A \setminus X)</span> is a vertex cover, and is a minimum vertex cover since <span class="math inline">M</span> is a maximum matching.</p>

<p>As a result, a bipartite graph <span class="math inline">G</span> with <span class="math inline">m</span> edges and maximum degree <span class="math inline">d</span> has a matching of size at least <span class="math inline">\frac m d</span>.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">C</span> be a vertex cover in <span class="math inline">G</span>. Clearly, each vertex in <span class="math inline">C</span> covers at most <span class="math inline">d</span> edges. Since there are <span class="math inline">m</span> edges, we need at least <span class="math inline">\frac m d</span> vertices to cover every edge.<br />
So the size of the minimum cover is at least <span class="math inline">\frac m d</span>. By Konig's theorem, the size of some matching is also at least <span class="math inline">\frac m d</span>.</p>

<p>Hall's theorem is often thought of in terms of the marriage metaphor, where one partition is the set of males, another female, and the edges determine eligibility between two people for marriage. The problem is determining whether it is possible to marry off everyone in one of the sets.</p>
<p>As it turns out, this is not possible if and only if there is a set of people in <span class="math inline">A</span> who can only marry a smaller set of people in <span class="math inline">B</span>, or vice versa. This is called <strong>Hall's condition</strong>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">D</span> is a set of vertices, then <span class="math inline">N(D)</span> is the set of vertices adjacent to at least one vertex in <span class="math inline">D</span>.

<p><strong>Hall's theorem</strong> states that given a bipartite graph with bipartition <span class="math inline">(A, B)</span>, we can guarantee that there is a matching that saturates all the vertices in <span class="math inline">A</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\forall D \subseteq A, \abs{N(D)} \ge \abs{B}</span>.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assume <span class="math inline">G</span> has a matching <span class="math inline">M</span> that saturates <span class="math inline">A</span> and <span class="math inline">D \subseteq A</span>, then the matching edges of <span class="math inline">M</span> that have one end in <span class="math inline">A</span> must have the other end in <span class="math inline">\abs{N(D)}</span>.<br />
So for every <span class="math inline">D \subseteq A</span>, <span class="math inline">\abs{N(D)} \ge \abs{D}</span>.<br />
Suppose <span class="math inline">G</span> does not have a matching that saturates <span class="math inline">A</span>. Let <span class="math inline">M</span> be a maximum matching of <span class="math inline">G</span>. Since <span class="math inline">M</span> does not saturate <span class="math inline">A</span>, <span class="math inline">\abs{M} &lt; \abs{A}</span>.<br />
By Konig's theorem, there is a maximum vertex cover <span class="math inline">C</span> such that <span class="math inline">\abs{C} = \abs{M}</span>. Since <span class="math inline">C</span> is a maximum vertex cover, there is no edge between <span class="math inline">A \setminus C</span> and <span class="math inline">B \setminus C</span>.<br />
So <span class="math inline">N(A \setminus C) \subseteq B \cap C</span>. So <span class="math inline">\abs{N(A \setminus C)} \le \abs{B \cap C}</span> and <span class="math inline">\abs{N(A \setminus C)} \le \abs{C} - \abs{A \cap C}</span> and <span class="math inline">\abs{N(A \setminus C)} \le \abs{M} - \abs{A \cap C}</span> and <span class="math inline">\abs{N(A \setminus C)} &lt; \abs{A} - \abs{A \cap C}</span> and <span class="math inline">\abs{N(A \setminus C)} &lt; \abs{A \setminus C}</span>.<br />
Clearly, this violates Hall's condition, so it is not the case that <span class="math inline">\forall D \subseteq A, \abs{N(D)} \ge \abs{B}</span>.</p>

Clearly, each vertex in <span class="math inline">N(D)</span> can accept only up to <span class="math inline">k</span> edges from <span class="math inline">D</span>, since the vertices have degree <span class="math inline">k</span> and the other end of each incident edge is in either <span class="math inline">D</span> or <span class="math inline">A \setminus D</span>.<br />
So <span class="math inline">\abs{N(D)} \ge \abs{D}</span> and Hall's condition holds. So there is a perfect matching of <span class="math inline">G</span>.<br />
Clearly, <span class="math inline">\abs{A} = \abs{B}</span> since the graph is <span class="math inline">k</span>-regular, so the set of all edges in <span class="math inline">G</span> is a perfect matching.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, the edges of a <span class="math inline">k</span>-regular bipartite graph can be partitioned into <span class="math inline">k</span> perfect matchings.</p>
<p>In other words, if we find a perfect matching in <span class="math inline">G</span> and remove all edges in <span class="math inline">M</span> from <span class="math inline">G</span> to get a <span class="math inline">k - 1</span>-regular graph, this graph has another perfect matching. We can repeat this until there is a 1-regular graph with a perfect matching. This can be proven using induction.</p>
<p>These theorems allow us to solve the stable marriage problem. The stable marriage problem can be stated as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are <span class="math inline">n</span> men and <span class="math inline">n</span> women. Each person ranks each of the <span class="math inline">n</span> people of the other gender with a number between 1 to <span class="math inline">n</span> such that each person of the other gender has a distinct number.<br />
The higher the ranking, the more this person would prefer to have the ranked person.<br />
Find a set of marriages such that everyone is married and no two people of different genders would both rather have each other than their current partners - a set of stable marriages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is always a set of stable marriages such that everyone is married. This can be proven using matchings on bipartite graphs.</p>
<p>The following is an algorithm for finding a set of stable marriage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>;wip</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The people proposing heavily affect the resulting set of stable marriages. If the men propose, then the marriages are made starting from the top ranked for the men and slowly move downward. If the women propose, then the marriages are made starting from the top ranked for women and move downward.</p>
<p>The stable roommate problem is similar, except anyone can be matched to anyone. The most significant difference is that there isn't always a stable solution for these problems.</p>
